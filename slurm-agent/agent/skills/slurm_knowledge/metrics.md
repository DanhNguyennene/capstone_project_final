## Metrics Overview [#overview](https://slurm.schedmd.com/metrics.html)
Slurm 25.11 introduced a comprehensive system for collecting and exposing
metrics related to cluster resources, job states, and scheduler performance.
The metrics system exposes real-time data about various Slurm entities through
HTTP endpoints provided by the slurmctld daemon.
The metrics feature enables integration with popular monitoring systems like
Prometheus, Grafana, and other observability tools.
## Configuration [#configuration](https://slurm.schedmd.com/metrics.html)
### Prerequisites [#prerequisites](https://slurm.schedmd.com/metrics.html)
The metrics feature requires specific configuration in slurm.conf :
- PrivateData must not be set : The metrics feature is disabled if any PrivateData parameter is configured in slurm.conf. This is a security requirement to prevent exposure of sensitive information through metrics.
- MetricsType parameter : Set the [MetricsType](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) parameter to specify which metrics plugin to use. Currently, only the OpenMetrics plugin is supported: ```text MetricsType=metrics/openmetrics ```
### Plugin Loading [#plugin_loading](https://slurm.schedmd.com/metrics.html)
The metrics plugin is automatically loaded by slurmctld when the
MetricsType parameter is configured.
## HTTP Endpoints [#endpoints](https://slurm.schedmd.com/metrics.html)
Slurm exposes metrics through HTTP GET endpoints on the slurmctld daemon's
listening port (default 6817). The following endpoints are available:
- GET /metrics - Print available metric endpoints
- GET /metrics/jobs - Job-related metrics including counts by state, resource allocation, and job statistics ([examples](https://slurm.schedmd.com/metrics.html))
- GET /metrics/jobs-users-accts - User- and account-specific job metrics ([examples](https://slurm.schedmd.com/metrics.html))
- GET /metrics/nodes - Node-related metrics including resource counts, states, and utilization ([examples](https://slurm.schedmd.com/metrics.html))
- GET /metrics/partitions - Partition-related metrics including job counts per partition and resource allocation ([examples](https://slurm.schedmd.com/metrics.html))
- GET /metrics/scheduler - Scheduler performance metrics including cycle times, backfill statistics, and queue lengths ([examples](https://slurm.schedmd.com/metrics.html))
All endpoints return data in UTF-8 text format making them compatible with
Prometheus and other monitoring systems.
## OpenMetrics Plugin [#openmetrics](https://slurm.schedmd.com/metrics.html)
The OpenMetrics plugin implements the [OpenMetrics 1.0](https://openmetrics.io/) specification, ensuring compatibility with Prometheus and
other monitoring systems that consume metrics in this format.
### Metric Format [#metric_format](https://slurm.schedmd.com/metrics.html)
Each metric follows the OpenMetrics format with the following components:
- Metric name : A descriptive name prefixed with "slurm_"
- Metric type : Only "gauge" metrics are exposed
- Metric value : The actual numeric value
- Labels : Optional key-value pairs for additional context
- Help text : Human-readable description of the metric
## Metric Categories Provided by Slurm [#categories](https://slurm.schedmd.com/metrics.html)
Each endpoint provides a set of metrics related to the same general category.
Numerous metrics are provided so they are not all documented on this page.
A few examples are provided for each category in the following subsections.
### Job Metrics [#job_metrics](https://slurm.schedmd.com/metrics.html)
Job metrics provide information about job states, resource allocation, and
job counts. Examples include:
- slurm_jobs - Total number of jobs
- slurm_jobs_running - Number of running jobs
- slurm_jobs_pending - Number of pending jobs (see note)
- slurm_jobs_cpus_alloc - Total CPUs allocated to jobs
- slurm_jobs_memory_alloc - Total memory allocated to jobs
NOTE : In Slurm, pending jobs include both jobs waiting for resources
and held jobs. Held jobs will not be scheduled until the hold is released.
### User- and Account-Specific Job Metrics [#ua_job_metrics](https://slurm.schedmd.com/metrics.html)
Job metrics for user and accounts provide a count of jobs in each state for
each active user and account in the system. It stores each entity under a
key-value pair. Remember that every unique key-value pair represents a new time
series, which can dramatically increase the amount of data stored.
Examples include:
- slurm_user_jobs_pending{username="john"} - Pending jobs for user "john"
- slurm_account_jobs_pending{account="smith"} - Pending jobs for account "smith"
### Node Metrics [#node_metrics](https://slurm.schedmd.com/metrics.html)
Node metrics track resource availability, node states, and utilization.
Examples include:
- slurm_nodes - Total number of nodes
- slurm_nodes_idle - Number of idle nodes
- slurm_nodes_alloc - Number of allocated nodes
- slurm_node_cpus{node="nodename"} - CPUs on the specified node
- slurm_node_memory_bytes{node="nodename"} - Memory on the specified node (bytes)
### Partition Metrics [#partition_metrics](https://slurm.schedmd.com/metrics.html)
Partition metrics show job distribution and resource allocation across
partitions. Examples include:
- slurm_partitions - Total number of partitions
- slurm_partition_jobs{partition="name"} - Jobs on the specified partition
- slurm_partition_nodes{partition="name"} - Nodes on the specified partition
The following metrics might be useful for
[Slinky](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slinky.html) or other systems
which have an auto-scale feature. By knowing the maximum number of nodes that a
job requested in a partition, the decision to extend the nodes of the partition
by this number can be considered. Jobs which are held are not included in these
metrics.
- slurm_partition_jobs_max_job_nodes_nohold - Gives the maximum number of nodes requested by any job from all pending jobs that are not held in the partition.
- slurm_partition_jobs_min_job_nodes_nohold - Gives the maximum of the minimum number of nodes requested by any job from all pending jobs that are not held in the partition.
### Scheduler Metrics [#scheduler_metrics](https://slurm.schedmd.com/metrics.html)
Scheduler metrics provide insights into scheduling performance and behavior.
Examples include:
- slurm_sched_cycle_cnt - Scheduling cycle count
- slurm_sched_cycle_last - Last scheduling cycle time
- slurm_bf_cycle_cnt - Backfill cycle count
- slurm_bf_active - Whether the backfill scheduler is currently running
## Security Considerations [#security](https://slurm.schedmd.com/metrics.html)
The metrics system has several important security implications:
- No authentication : There is no built-in authentication mechanism for metrics endpoints. Anyone with network access to the slurmctld port can query metrics.
- PrivateData dependency : The metrics feature is automatically disabled when any PrivateData parameter is set in slurm.conf to prevent exposure of sensitive information.
- Network access : Metrics are exposed through the slurmctld network interface. Consider firewall rules and network segmentation to control access.
- Information disclosure : Metrics may reveal information about cluster utilization, job patterns, and user activity that could be considered sensitive in some environments.
## Performance Impact [#performance](https://slurm.schedmd.com/metrics.html)
Metrics collection and exposition can impact slurmctld performance:
- Lock contention : Querying metrics requires acquiring various locks within slurmctld, which can impact scheduler performance during high-frequency queries.
- Data collection overhead : Metrics are collected in real-time from slurmctld's internal data structures, which adds computational overhead.
- Data processing overhead in the external monitoring system : We provide endpoints for unbounded entities like users and accounts metrics. A monitoring system may treat each entity as a new time series, which can dramatically increase the amount of data stored.
- Network I/O : Frequent metric queries generate network traffic and consume slurmctld's network I/O capacity, especially on systems with thousands of jobs, users or accounts.
To minimize performance impact:
- Configure appropriate scrape intervals in monitoring systems (e.g., 60-120 seconds)
- Use caching mechanisms in monitoring systems when possible
- Monitor slurmctld performance when enabling metrics
- Do not use unbounded metric endpoints like /metrics/jobs-users-accts to store data in your monitoring system
