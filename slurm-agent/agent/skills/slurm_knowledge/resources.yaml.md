# resources.yaml
Section: Slurm Configuration File (5)
Updated: Slurm Configuration File
[Index](https://slurm.schedmd.com/resources.yaml.html)
## NAME[#SECTION_NAME](https://slurm.schedmd.com/resources.yaml.html)
resources.yaml - Slurm configuration file for the Hierarchical Resources (HRES).
## DESCRIPTION[#SECTION_DESCRIPTION](https://slurm.schedmd.com/resources.yaml.html)
resources.yaml is a YAML-formatted configuration file that defines
Hierarchical Resources (HRES).
The file must be located in the same directory as slurm.conf . Any text
following a "#" in this file is treated as a comment through the end of that
line.
Additional details are available in
the Hierarchical Resource (HRES) Scheduling page:
<[https://slurm.schedmd.com/hres.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/hres.html)>
## PARAMETERS[#SECTION_PARAMETERS](https://slurm.schedmd.com/resources.yaml.html)
Each Hierarchical Resources definition is a YAML object containing the following
attributes:
resource [#OPT_resource](https://slurm.schedmd.com/resources.yaml.html) The unique name for the resource. This name will be used to identify it by
slurmctld. This must be the first attribute in the object.
mode [#OPT_mode](https://slurm.schedmd.com/resources.yaml.html) The planning mode for the resource. Must be one of the following:
MODE_1 [#OPT_MODE_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/resources.yaml.html) Sufficient resources are required on only one layer that overlaps with the
job's allocated nodes.
MODE_2 [#OPT_MODE_2](https://slurm.schedmd.com/resources.yaml.html) Sufficient resources must be available on all layers that overlap with the
job's allocated nodes.
MODE_3 [#OPT_MODE_3](https://slurm.schedmd.com/resources.yaml.html) Resources are allocated on a per-node basis. The scheduler calculates total
consumption from the most granular layer and sums it up into the successively
higher layers, ensuring the count is not exceeded at any layer. This mode
is designed for consumable resources like power and can be mapped to a block
topology using the topology parameter.
topology [#OPT_topology](https://slurm.schedmd.com/resources.yaml.html) (Optional) Specifies the name of a topology/block definition to map to
this resource. This parameter is only valid for MODE_3 resources.
The HRes layers must have the same layout as the specified block topology. This
enables the scheduler to simultaneously optimize both the HRes and block
topology allocations.
variables [#OPT_variables](https://slurm.schedmd.com/resources.yaml.html) (Optional) A list of name/value pairs that map arbitrary text strings to
administratively-defined resource counts. Users can then use these strings in
job submissions (e.g., --resources=power:full_node ) instead of a numeric
value. Each entry in the list contains:
name [#OPT_name](https://slurm.schedmd.com/resources.yaml.html) The string alias for the value (e.g., "full_node").
value [#OPT_value](https://slurm.schedmd.com/resources.yaml.html) The numeric resource count (e.g., 1000).
layers [#OPT_layers](https://slurm.schedmd.com/resources.yaml.html) A list of layers that define the resource hierarchy. Each layer is a YAML object
containing:
nodes [#OPT_nodes](https://slurm.schedmd.com/resources.yaml.html) A list of node names or hostlist expressions that are part of this layer.
count [#OPT_count](https://slurm.schedmd.com/resources.yaml.html) The total number of resources available in this specific layer.
base [#OPT_base](https://slurm.schedmd.com/resources.yaml.html) (Optional) A list of name/value pairs describing non-job-related (static)
resource consumption in this layer. This is particularly relevant for
MODE_3 . Each entry contains:
name [#OPT_name_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/resources.yaml.html) The name of the static resource consumer (e.g., "storage", "network1").
value [#OPT_value_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/resources.yaml.html) The numeric resource count this consumer uses.
