# slurm.conf
Section: Slurm Configuration File (5)
Updated: Slurm Configuration File
[Index](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html)
## NAME[#SECTION_NAME](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html)
slurm.conf - Slurm configuration file
## DESCRIPTION[#SECTION_DESCRIPTION](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html)
slurm.conf is an ASCII file which describes general Slurm
configuration information, the nodes to be managed, information about
how those nodes are grouped into partitions, and various scheduling
parameters associated with those partitions. This file should be
consistent across all nodes in the cluster.
The file location can be modified at execution time by setting the SLURM_CONF
environment variable. The Slurm daemons also allow you to override
both the built-in and environment-provided location using the "-f"
option on the command line.
The contents of the file are case insensitive except for the names of nodes
and partitions. Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated
as a comment through the end of that line.
Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of
Slurm daemons, daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal, or execution
of the command "scontrol reconfigure" unless otherwise noted.
Changes to TCP listening settings will require a daemon restart.
If a line begins with the word "Include" followed by whitespace
and then a file name, that file will be included inline with the current
configuration file. For large or complex systems, multiple configuration files
may prove easier to manage and enable reuse of some files (See INCLUDE
MODIFIERS for more details).
Note on file permissions:
The slurm.conf file must be readable by all users of Slurm, since it
is used by many of the Slurm commands. Other files that are defined
in the slurm.conf file, such as log files and job accounting files,
may need to be created/owned by the user "SlurmUser" to be successfully
accessed. Use the "chown" and "chmod" commands to set the ownership
and permissions appropriately.
See the section FILE AND DIRECTORY PERMISSIONS for information
about the various files and directories used by Slurm.
## PARAMETERS[#SECTION_PARAMETERS](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html)
The overall configuration parameters available include:
AccountingStorageBackupHost [#OPT_AccountingStorageBackupHost](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The name of the backup machine hosting the accounting storage database.
If used with the accounting_storage/slurmdbd plugin, this is where the backup
slurmdbd would be running.
Only used with systems using SlurmDBD, ignored otherwise.
AccountingStorageEnforce [#OPT_AccountingStorageEnforce](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) This controls what level of association-based enforcement to impose
on job submissions. Valid options are any comma-separated combination of the
following, many of which will implicitly include other options:
all [#OPT_all](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Implies all other available options except nojobs and nosteps .
associations [#OPT_associations](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) No new job is allowed to run unless a corresponding association exists in the
system.
limits [#OPT_limits](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Users can be limited by association to whatever job size or run time limits are
defined. Implies associations .
nojobs [#OPT_nojobs](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Slurm will not account for any jobs or steps on the system.
Implies nosteps .
nosteps [#OPT_nosteps](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Slurm will not account for any steps that have run.
qos [#OPT_qos](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Jobs will not be scheduled unless a valid qos is specified.
Implies associations .
safe [#OPT_safe](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) A job will only be launched against an association or qos that has a
TRES-minutes limit set if the job will be able to run to completion. Without
this option set, jobs will be launched as long as their usage hasn't reached
the TRES-minutes limit. This can lead to jobs being launched but then killed
when the limit is reached. With this option, a job won't be killed due to limits,
even if the limits are changed after the job was started and the association or
qos violates the updated limits. Implies limits and associations .
wckeys [#OPT_wckeys](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Jobs will not be scheduled unless a valid workload characterization key is
specified. Implies associations and TrackWCKey (a separate
configuration option).
AccountingStorageExternalHost [#OPT_AccountingStorageExternalHost](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) A comma-separated list of external slurmdbds (<host/ip>[:port][,...]) to
register with. If no port is given, the AccountingStoragePort will be
used.
This allows clusters registered with the external slurmdbd to communicate with
each other using the --cluster/-M client command options.
The cluster will add itself to the external slurmdbd if it doesn't exist. If a
non-external cluster already exists on the external slurmdbd, the slurmctld
will ignore registering to the external slurmdbd.
AccountingStorageHost [#OPT_AccountingStorageHost](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The name of the machine hosting the accounting storage database.
Only used with systems using SlurmDBD, ignored otherwise.
AccountingStorageParameters [#OPT_AccountingStorageParameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Comma-separated list of options.
max_step_records =#[#OPT_max_step_records](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The number of steps that are recorded in the database for each job -- excluding
batch, extern, and interactive steps.
The following comma-separated list of key-value options are used to establish
a secure connection to the database:
SSL_CERT [#OPT_SSL_CERT](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The path name of the client public key certificate file.
SSL_CA [#OPT_SSL_CA](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The path name of the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate file.
SSL_CAPATH [#OPT_SSL_CAPATH](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The path name of the directory that contains trusted SSL CA certificate files.
SSL_KEY [#OPT_SSL_KEY](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The path name of the client private key file.
SSL_CIPHER [#OPT_SSL_CIPHER](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The list of permissible ciphers for SSL encryption.
AccountingStoragePass [#OPT_AccountingStoragePass](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The password used to gain access to the database to store the
accounting data. Only used for database type storage plugins, ignored
otherwise. In the case of SlurmDBD (Database Daemon) with MUNGE
authentication this can be configured to use a MUNGE daemon
specifically configured to provide authentication between clusters
while the default MUNGE daemon provides authentication within a
cluster. In that case, AccountingStoragePass should specify the
named port to be used for communications with the alternate MUNGE
daemon (e.g. "/var/run/munge/global.socket.2"). The default value is
NULL.
AccountingStoragePort [#OPT_AccountingStoragePort](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The listening port of the accounting storage database server.
Only used for database type storage plugins, ignored otherwise.
The default value is SLURMDBD_PORT as established at system
build time. If no value is explicitly specified, it will be set to 6819.
This value must be equal to the DbdPort parameter in the
slurmdbd.conf file.
AccountingStorageTRES [#OPT_AccountingStorageTRES](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Comma-separated list of resources you wish to track on the cluster.
These are the resources requested by the sbatch/srun job when it
is submitted. Currently this consists of any GRES, BB (burst buffer) or
license along with CPU, Memory, Node, Energy, FS/[Disk|Lustre], IC/OFED, Pages,
and VMem. By default Billing, CPU, Energy, Memory, Node, FS/Disk, Pages and VMem
are tracked. These default TRES cannot be disabled, but only appended to.
AccountingStorageTRES=gres/craynetwork,license/iop1
will track billing, cpu, energy, memory, nodes, fs/disk, pages and vmem along
with a gres called craynetwork as well as a license called iop1. Whenever these
resources are used on the cluster they are recorded. The TRES are automatically
set up in the database on the start of the slurmctld.
If multiple GRES of different types are tracked (e.g. GPUs of different types),
then job requests with matching type specifications will be recorded.
Given a configuration of
"AccountingStorageTRES=gres/gpu,gres/gpu:tesla,gres/gpu:volta"
Then "gres/gpu:tesla" and "gres/gpu:volta" will track only jobs that explicitly
request those two GPU types, while "gres/gpu" will track allocated GPUs of any
type ("tesla", "volta" or any other GPU type).
Given a configuration of
"AccountingStorageTRES=gres/gpu:tesla,gres/gpu:volta"
Then "gres/gpu:tesla" and "gres/gpu:volta" will track jobs that explicitly
request those GPU types.
If a job requests GPUs, but does not explicitly specify the GPU type, then
its resource allocation will be accounted for as either "gres/gpu:tesla" or
"gres/gpu:volta", although the accounting may not match the actual GPU type
allocated to the job and the GPUs allocated to the job could be heterogeneous.
In an environment containing various GPU types, use of a job_submit plugin
may be desired in order to force jobs to explicitly specify some GPU type.
NOTE : Setting gres/gpu will also set gres/gpumem and gres/gpuutil.
gres/gpumem and gres/gpuutil can be set individually when gres/gpu is not set.
AccountingStorageType [#OPT_AccountingStorageType](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The accounting storage mechanism type. Unset by default, which indicates
that accounting records are not maintained.
Current options are:
accounting_storage/slurmdbd [#OPT_accounting_storage/slurmdbd](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The accounting records will be written to the SlurmDBD, which manages an
underlying MySQL database. See "man slurmdbd" for more information.
AccountingStoreFlags [#OPT_AccountingStoreFlags](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Comma separated list used to modify which fields the slurmctld send to the
accounting database.
Current options are:
job_comment [#OPT_job_comment](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Include the job's comment field in the job complete message sent to the Accounting Storage database.
Note the AdminComment and SystemComment are always recorded in the database.
job_env [#OPT_job_env](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Include a batch job's environment variables used at job submission in the job
start message sent to the Accounting Storage database.
job_extra [#OPT_job_extra](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Include the job's extra field in the job complete message sent to the Accounting
Storage database.
job_script [#OPT_job_script](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Include the job's batch script in the job start message sent to the Accounting Storage database.
no_stdio [#OPT_no_stdio](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Exclude the stdio paths when recording data into the database on a job or
step start. StdOut, StdErr and StdIn db fields for jobs and steps will be empty.
AcctGatherNodeFreq [#OPT_AcctGatherNodeFreq](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The AcctGather plugins sampling interval for node accounting.
For AcctGather plugin values of none, this parameter is ignored.
For all other values this parameter is the number
of seconds between node accounting samples. For the
acct_gather_energy/rapl plugin, set a value less
than 300 because the counters may overflow beyond this rate.
The default value is zero. This value disables accounting sampling
for nodes. Note: The accounting sampling interval for jobs is
determined by the value of JobAcctGatherFrequency .
AcctGatherEnergyType [#OPT_AcctGatherEnergyType](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Identifies the plugin to be used for energy consumption accounting.
The jobacct_gather plugin and slurmd daemon call this plugin to collect
energy consumption data for jobs and nodes. The collection of energy
consumption data takes place on the node level, hence only in case of exclusive
job allocation the energy consumption measurements will reflect the job's
real consumption. In case of node sharing between jobs the reported consumed
energy per job (through sstat or sacct) will not reflect the real energy
consumed by the jobs. Default is nothing is collected.
Configurable values at present are:
acct_gather_energy/gpu [#OPT_acct_gather_energy/gpu](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Energy consumption data is collected from the GPU management library (e.g. rsmi)
for the corresponding type of GPU. Only available for rsmi at present.
Note: slurmd will keep gpu plugin loaded after configuration when this is set.
acct_gather_energy/ipmi [#OPT_acct_gather_energy/ipmi](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Energy consumption data is collected from the Baseboard Management Controller
(BMC) using the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI).
acct_gather_energy/pm_counters [#OPT_acct_gather_energy/pm_counters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Energy consumption data is collected from the Baseboard Management
Controller (BMC) for HPE Cray systems.
acct_gather_energy/rapl [#OPT_acct_gather_energy/rapl](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Energy consumption data is collected from hardware sensors using the Running
Average Power Limit (RAPL) mechanism. Note that enabling RAPL may require the
execution of the command "sudo modprobe msr".
acct_gather_energy/xcc [#OPT_acct_gather_energy/xcc](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Energy consumption data is collected from the Lenovo SD650 XClarity Controller
(XCC) using IPMI OEM raw commands.
AcctGatherInterconnectType [#OPT_AcctGatherInterconnectType](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Identifies the plugin to be used for interconnect network traffic accounting.
The jobacct_gather plugin and slurmd daemon call this plugin to collect
network traffic data for jobs and nodes.
The collection of network traffic data takes place on the node level,
hence only in case of exclusive job allocation the collected values will
reflect the job's real traffic. In case of node sharing between jobs the reported
network traffic per job (through sstat or sacct) will not reflect the real
network traffic by the jobs.
Configurable values at present are:
acct_gather_interconnect/ofed [#OPT_acct_gather_interconnect/ofed](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Infiniband network traffic data are collected from the hardware monitoring
counters of Infiniband devices through the OFED library.
In order to account for per job network traffic, add the "ic/ofed" TRES to
AccountingStorageTRES .
acct_gather_interconnect/sysfs [#OPT_acct_gather_interconnect/sysfs](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Network traffic statistics are collected from the Linux sysfs
pseudo-filesystem for specific interfaces defined in
[acct_gather.conf](https://slurm.schedmd.com/acct_gather.conf.html) (5).
In order to account for per job network traffic, add the "ic/sysfs" TRES to
AccountingStorageTRES .
AcctGatherFilesystemType [#OPT_AcctGatherFilesystemType](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Identifies the plugin to be used for filesystem traffic accounting.
The jobacct_gather plugin and slurmd daemon call this plugin to collect
filesystem traffic data for jobs and nodes.
The collection of filesystem traffic data takes place on the node level,
hence only in case of exclusive job allocation the collected values will
reflect the job's real traffic. In case of node sharing between jobs the reported
filesystem traffic per job (through sstat or sacct) will not reflect the real
filesystem traffic by the jobs.
Configurable values at present are:
acct_gather_filesystem/lustre [#OPT_acct_gather_filesystem/lustre](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Lustre filesystem traffic data are collected from the counters found in
/proc/fs/lustre/.
In order to account for per job lustre traffic, add the "fs/lustre" TRES to
AccountingStorageTRES .
AcctGatherProfileType [#OPT_AcctGatherProfileType](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Identifies the plugin to be used for detailed job profiling.
The jobacct_gather plugin and slurmd daemon call this plugin to collect
detailed data such as I/O counts, memory usage, or energy consumption for jobs
and nodes. There are interfaces in this plugin to collect data as step start
and completion, task start and completion, and at the account gather
frequency. The data collected at the node level is related to jobs only in
case of exclusive job allocation.
Configurable values at present are:
acct_gather_profile/hdf5 [#OPT_acct_gather_profile/hdf5](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) This enables the HDF5 plugin. The directory where the profile files
are stored and which values are collected are configured in the
acct_gather.conf file.
acct_gather_profile/influxdb [#OPT_acct_gather_profile/influxdb](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) This enables the influxdb plugin. The influxdb instance host, port, database,
retention policy and which values are collected are configured in the
acct_gather.conf file.
AllowSpecResourcesUsage [#OPT_AllowSpecResourcesUsage](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set to "YES", Slurm allows individual jobs to override node's configured
CoreSpecCount value. For a job to take advantage of this feature,
a command line option of --core-spec must be specified. The default
value for this option is "YES" for Cray systems and "NO" for other system types.
AuthAltTypes [#OPT_AuthAltTypes](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Comma-separated list of alternative authentication plugins that the slurmctld
will permit for communication. Acceptable values at present include
auth/jwt .
NOTE : If AuthAltParameters is not used to specify a path to the
required jwt_hs256.key then slurmctld will default to looking for it in the
StateSaveLocation .
The jwt_hs256.key should only be visible to the SlurmUser and root. It is not
suggested to place the jwt_hs256.key on any nodes other than the machine running
slurmctld and the machine running slurmdbd .
auth/jwt can be activated by the presence of the SLURM_JWT
environment variable. When activated, it will override the default
AuthType .
AuthAltParameters [#OPT_AuthAltParameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Used to define alternative authentication plugins options. Multiple options may
be comma separated.
disable_token_creation [#OPT_disable_token_creation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Disable "scontrol token" use by non-SlurmUser accounts.
max_token_lifespan =<seconds>[#OPT_max_token_lifespan](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Set max lifespan (in seconds) for any token generated for user accounts. Limit
applies to all users except SlurmUser. Sites wishing to have per user limits
should generate tokens using JWT-compatible tools, and/or an authenticating
proxy, instead of using scontrol token .
jwks =[#OPT_jwks](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Absolute path to JWKS file. Key should be owned by SlurmUser or root, must be
readable by SlurmUser, with suggested permissions of 0400. It must not be
writable by 'other'.
Only RS256 keys are supported, although other key types may be listed in the
file. If set, no HS256 key will be loaded by default (and token generation is
disabled), although the jwt_key setting may be used to explicitly re-enable
HS256 key use (and token generation).
jwt_key =[#OPT_jwt_key](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Absolute path to JWT key file. Key must be HS256. Key should be owned by
SlurmUser or root, must be readable by SlurmUser, with suggested permissions of
0400. It must not be accessible by 'other'.
If not set, the default key file is jwt_hs256.key in StateSaveLocation .
userclaimfield =[#OPT_userclaimfield](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Use an alternative claim field for the Slurm UserName ( sun ) field. This
option is designed to allow compatibility with tokens generated outside of
Slurm. (This field may also be known as a grant.)
Default: (disabled)
AuthInfo [#OPT_AuthInfo](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Additional information to be used for authentication of communications
between the Slurm daemons (slurmctld and slurmd) and the Slurm
clients. The interpretation of this option is specific to the
configured AuthType .
Multiple options may be specified in a comma-delimited list.
If not specified, the default authentication information will be used.
cred_expire [#OPT_cred_expire](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Default job step credential lifetime, in seconds (e.g. "cred_expire=1200").
It must be sufficiently long enough to load user environment, run prolog,
deal with the slurmd getting paged out of memory, etc.
This also controls how long a requeued job must wait before starting again.
The default value is 120 seconds.
socket [#OPT_socket](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Path name to a MUNGE daemon socket to use
(e.g. "socket=/var/run/munge/munge.socket.2").
The default value is "/var/run/munge/munge.socket.2".
Used by auth/munge and cred/munge .
ttl [#OPT_ttl](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Credential lifetime, in seconds (e.g. "ttl=300").
The default value is dependent on the AuthType used.
For auth/munge , the default value is dependent upon the MUNGE
installation, but is typically 300 seconds. For auth/slurm , the default
value is 60 seconds. For auth/jwt , the default value is 1800 seconds.
use_client_ids [#OPT_use_client_ids](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Allow the auth/slurm plugin to authenticate users without relying on
the user information from LDAP or the operating system. When coupled with
nss_slurm, the user information can be managed on the compute nodes by
slurmstepd. This would allow the cluster to operate in an environment where
only the login nodes have access to LDAP/OS user information.
See <[https://slurm.schedmd.com/nss_slurm.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/nss_slurm.html)> for more information.
AuthType [#OPT_AuthType](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The authentication method for communications between Slurm
components.
All Slurm daemons and commands must be terminated prior to changing
the value of AuthType and later restarted.
Changes to this value will interrupt outstanding job steps and prevent them
from completing, so no jobs should be running when this is changed.
See <[https://slurm.schedmd.com/authentication.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/authentication.html)> for more information.
Acceptable values at present:
auth/munge [#OPT_auth/munge](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Indicates that MUNGE is to be used (default).
(See "[https://dun.github.io/munge/](https://dun.github.io/munge/)" for more information).
auth/slurm [#OPT_auth/slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Use Slurm's internal authentication plugin.
BatchStartTimeout [#OPT_BatchStartTimeout](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum time (in seconds) that a batch job is permitted for
launching before being considered missing and releasing the
allocation. The default value is 10 (seconds). Larger values may be
required if more time is required to execute the Prolog , load
user environment variables, or if the slurmd daemon gets paged from memory.
NOTE : The test for a job being successfully launched is only performed when
the Slurm daemon on the compute node registers state with the slurmctld daemon
on the head node, which happens fairly rarely.
Therefore a job will not necessarily be terminated if its start time exceeds
BatchStartTimeout .
This configuration parameter is also applied to launch tasks and avoid aborting
srun commands due to long running Prolog scripts.
BcastExclude [#OPT_BcastExclude](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Comma-separated list of absolute directory paths to be excluded when
autodetecting and broadcasting executable shared object dependencies through
sbcast or srun --bcast . The keyword " none " can be used to
indicate that no directory paths should be excluded. The default value is
" /lib,/usr/lib,/lib64,/usr/lib64 ". This option can be overridden by
sbcast --exclude and srun --bcast-exclude .
BcastParameters [#OPT_BcastParameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Controls sbcast and srun --bcast behavior. Multiple options can be specified
in a comma separated list.
Supported values include:
DestDir =[#OPT_DestDir](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Destination directory for file being broadcast to allocated compute nodes.
Default value is current working directory, or --chdir for srun if set.
Compression =[#OPT_Compression](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specify default file compression library to be used.
Supported values are "lz4" and "none".
The default value with the sbcast --compress option is "lz4" and "none" otherwise.
Some compression libraries may be unavailable on some systems.
send_libs [#OPT_send_libs](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, attempt to autodetect and broadcast the executable's shared object
dependencies to allocated compute nodes. The files are placed in a directory
alongside the executable. For srun only, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is
automatically updated to include this cache directory as well.
This can be overridden with either sbcast or srun
--send-libs option. By default this is disabled.
BurstBufferType [#OPT_BurstBufferType](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The plugin used to manage burst buffers. Unset by default.
Acceptable values at present are:
burst_buffer/datawarp [#OPT_burst_buffer/datawarp](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Use Cray DataWarp API to provide burst buffer functionality.
burst_buffer/lua [#OPT_burst_buffer/lua](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) This plugin provides hooks to an API that is defined by a Lua script. This
plugin was developed to provide system administrators with a way to do any task
(not only file staging) at different points in a job's life cycle.
CertgenParameters [#OPT_CertgenParameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Comma-separated options identifying certgen plugin options.
Supported values include:
certgen_script= [#OPT_certgen_script=](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Absolute path to executable script to generate self-signed TLS certificate.
The private key generated by keygen_script is passed in as stdin, and
only the certificate PEM file should be printed to stdout. Must return 0 on
success, and non-zero on error.
keygen_script= [#OPT_keygen_script=](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Absolute path to executable script to generate private key used later to
generate a self-signed certificate. Only the private key PEM file should be
printed to stdout, which will be later sent as stdin to certgen_script .
Must return 0 on success, and non-zero on error.
CertgenType [#OPT_CertgenType](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specify the certgen plugin that will be used.
Acceptable values at present:
certgen/script [#OPT_certgen/script](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Use built-in/configured scripts to generate certificate key pair.
CertmgrParameters [#OPT_CertmgrParameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Used to define parameters for certmgr plugin.
certificate_renewal_period= [#OPT_certificate_renewal_period=](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) slurmd/sackd will request a new signed certificate from slurmctld at this
specified interval (in minutes).
Default is 1440 minutes (once per day).
generate_csr_script= [#OPT_generate_csr_script=](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Path to script used to generate certificate signing requests. The nodename is
passed in as an argument to the script. The script must print only the
certificate signing request PEM file to stdout, and return 0 on success. Must
return non-zero on error.
Required with certmgr/script. Only run by daemons requesting certificates.
get_node_cert_key_script= [#OPT_get_node_cert_key_script=](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Path to script used to get node's private key which was used to generate the
CSR returned by generate_csr_script . The nodename is passed in as an
argument to the script. The script must print the node's private key (PEM file)
to stdout. Must return 0 on success, and non-zero on error.
Required with certmgr/script. Only run by daemons requesting certificates.
get_node_token_script= [#OPT_get_node_token_script=](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Path to script used to get node's unique token which will be validated by
slurmctld using the script set by validate_node_script= .
The nodename is passed in as an argument to the script. The script must print
the node's unique token to stdout, and return 0 on success. Must return
non-zero on error.
Required with certmgr/script. Only run by daemons requesting certificates.
sign_csr_script= [#OPT_sign_csr_script=](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Path to script used to sign incoming certificate signing requests.
This script will only be called if validate_node_script= was
already called on the accompanying unique node token and returned with a
non-zero exit code.
The certificate signing request (as given by generate_csr_script= ) is
passed as an argument to this script.
The script must print the new signed certificate to stdout, and return 0 on
success. Must return non-zero on error.
Required with certmgr/script. Only run by slurmctld.
single_use_tokens [#OPT_single_use_tokens](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Unique node tokens that are dynamically set (e.g. set via scontrol) will be
consumed upon successful certificate signing.
validate_node_script= [#OPT_validate_node_script=](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Path to script used to validate a unique node token.
The unique node token is passed as an argument to this script.
If the script finds the node token to be valid, return 0.
Otherwise, if the node token is invalid, return non-zero.
Required with certmgr/script. Only run by slurmctld.
CertmgrType [#OPT_CertmgrType](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Plugin used to dynamically renew TLS certificates for slurmd/sackd.
certmgr/script [#OPT_certmgr/script](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Use script hooks to implement certificate management. See
CertmgrParameters for details on how to setup these scripts.
CliFilterParameters [#OPT_CliFilterParameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Extra parameters for cli_filter plugins. Multiple options may be
comma-separated. Acceptable values at present are:
cli_filter_lua_path = <path> [#OPT_cli_filter_lua_path](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Absolute path to the cli_filter.lua script to be used when cli_filter/lua is
enabled. If this is not defined, the default path will be used instead (same
path to slurm.conf).
NOTE : The configured directory containing the cli_filter.lua script should
have 755 permissions, the script itself 644 and both be owned by SlurmdUser.
CliFilterPlugins [#OPT_CliFilterPlugins](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) A comma-delimited list of command line interface option filter/modification
plugins. The specified plugins will be executed in the order listed.
No cli_filter plugins are used by default. Acceptable values at present are:
cli_filter/lua [#OPT_cli_filter/lua](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) This plugin allows you to write your own implementation of a cli_filter
using lua.
cli_filter/syslog [#OPT_cli_filter/syslog](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) This plugin enables logging of job submission activities performed. All the
salloc/sbatch/srun options are logged to syslog together with environment
variables in JSON format. If the plugin is not the last one in the list it may
log values different than what was actually sent to slurmctld.
cli_filter/user_defaults [#OPT_cli_filter/user_defaults](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) This plugin looks for the file $HOME/.slurm/defaults and reads every line of it
as a key = value pair, where key is any of the job submission
options available to salloc/sbatch/srun and value is a default value
defined by the user. For instance:
```text
time=1:30 mem=2048
```
The above will result in a user defined default for each of their jobs of
"-t 1:30" and "--mem=2048".
ClusterName [#OPT_ClusterName](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The name by which this Slurm managed cluster is known in the
accounting database. This is needed to distinguish accounting records
when multiple clusters report to the same database. Because of limitations
in some databases, any upper case letters in the name will be silently mapped
to lower case. In order to avoid confusion, it is recommended that the name
be lower case. The cluster name must be 40 characters or less in order to
comply with the limit on the maximum length for table names in MySQL/MariaDB.
CommunicationParameters [#OPT_CommunicationParameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Comma-separated options identifying communication options.
block_null_hash [#OPT_block_null_hash](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Require all Slurm authentication tokens to include a newer (20.11.9 and
21.08.8) payload that provides an additional layer of security against
credential replay attacks. This option should only be enabled once all Slurm
daemons have been upgraded to 20.11.9/21.08.8 or newer, and all jobs that were
started before the upgrade have been completed.
disable_http [#OPT_disable_http](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Prevent slurmctld and slurmd from responding to incoming HTTP requests.
host_unreach_retry_count =#[#OPT_host_unreach_retry_count](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) When a node tries to connect() to another node, connect() may return an error
with EHOSTUNREACH if the host is unreachable. If this parameter is set, this
is the number of times that Slurm will retry making that connection. Slurm will
wait for 500 milliseconds in between each try. The default for this parameter
is zero (Slurm will not retry if EHOSTUNREACH is returned).
DisableIPv4 [#OPT_DisableIPv4](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Disable IPv4 only operation for all slurm daemons (except slurmdbd). This
should also be set in your slurmdbd.conf file.
EnableIPv6 [#OPT_EnableIPv6](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Enable using IPv6 addresses for all slurm daemons (except slurmdbd). When
using both IPv4 and IPv6, address family preferences will be based on your
/etc/gai.conf file. This should also be set in your slurmdbd.conf file.
getnameinfo_cache_timeout [#OPT_getnameinfo_cache_timeout](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) When munge is used as AuthType slurmctld makes use of getnameinfo to obtain
the hostname from IP address stored in munge credential. This parameter controls
the number of seconds slurmctld should keep the IP to hostname resolution. When
set to 0 cache is disabled. The default value is 60.
keepaliveinterval =#[#OPT_keepaliveinterval](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specifies the interval, in seconds, between keepalive probes on idle
connections.
This affects connections between srun and its slurmstepd process as well as all
connections to the slurmdbd.
The default is to use the system default settings.
keepaliveprobes =#[#OPT_keepaliveprobes](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specifies the number of unacknowledged keepalive probes sent before considering
the connection broken.
This affects connections between srun and its slurmstepd process as well as all
connections to the slurmdbd.
The default is to use the system default settings.
keepalivetime =#[#OPT_keepalivetime](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specifies how long, in seconds, before a connection is marked as needing a
keepalive probe as well as how long to delay closing a connection to process
messages still in the queue.
This affects connections between srun and its slurmstepd process as well as all
connections to the slurmdbd.
Longer values can be used to improve reliability of communications in the event
of network failures.
The default is for keepalive to be disabled.
NoCtldInAddrAny [#OPT_NoCtldInAddrAny](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Used to directly bind to the address of what the node resolves to running
the slurmctld instead of binding messages to any address on the node,
which is the default.
NoInAddrAny [#OPT_NoInAddrAny](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Used to directly bind to the address of what the node resolves to instead
of binding messages to any address on the node which is the default.
This option is for all daemons/clients except for the slurmctld.
CompleteWait [#OPT_CompleteWait](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The time to wait, in seconds, when any job is in the COMPLETING state
before any additional jobs are scheduled. This is to attempt to keep jobs on
nodes that were recently in use, with the goal of preventing fragmentation.
If set to zero, pending jobs will be started as soon as possible.
Since a COMPLETING job's resources are released for use by other
jobs as soon as the Epilog completes on each individual node,
this can result in very fragmented resource allocations.
To provide jobs with the minimum response time, a value of zero is
recommended (no waiting).
To minimize fragmentation of resources, a value equal to KillWait
plus two is recommended.
In that case, setting KillWait to a small value may be beneficial.
The default value of CompleteWait is zero seconds.
The value may not exceed 65533.
NOTE : Setting reduce_completing_frag affects the behavior
of CompleteWait .
CpuFreqDef [#OPT_CpuFreqDef](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Default CPU governor to use when running a job step if it has not been

job step credentials.
Acceptable values at present are:
cred/munge [#OPT_cred/munge](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Indicates that Munge is to be used (default).
cred/slurm [#OPT_cred/slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Use Slurm's internal credential format.
DataParserParameters =< data_parser >[#OPT_DataParserParameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Apply default value for data_parser plugin parameters. See --json or
--yaml arguments in [sacct](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sacct.html) (1), [scontrol](https://slurm.schedmd.com/scontrol.html) (1), [sinfo](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sinfo.html) (1),

Default: Latest data_parser plugin version with no flags selected.
DebugFlags [#OPT_DebugFlags](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Defines specific subsystems which should provide more detailed event logging.
Multiple subsystems can be specified with comma separators.
Most DebugFlags will result in additional logging messages for the identified
subsystems if SlurmctldDebug is at 'verbose' or higher.
More logging may impact performance.
NOTE : You can also set debug flags by having the SLURM_DEBUG_FLAGS
environment variable defined with the desired flags when the process (client
command, daemon, etc.) is started.
The environment variable takes precedence over the setting in the slurm.conf.

Triggers [#OPT_Triggers](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Slurmctld triggers
DefCpuPerGPU [#OPT_DefCpuPerGPU](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Default count of CPUs allocated per allocated GPU. This value is used only if
the job didn't specify --cpus-per-task and --cpus-per-gpu.
DefMemPerCPU [#OPT_DefMemPerCPU](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Default real memory size available per usable allocated CPU in megabytes.
Used to avoid over-subscribing memory and causing paging.
DefMemPerCPU would generally be used if individual processors
are allocated to jobs ( SelectType=select/cons_tres ).
The default value is 0 (unlimited).
Also see DefMemPerGPU , DefMemPerNode and MaxMemPerCPU .
DefMemPerCPU , DefMemPerGPU and DefMemPerNode are
mutually exclusive.
NOTE : This applies to usable allocated CPUs in a job allocation.
This is important when more than one thread per core is configured.
If a job requests --threads-per-core with fewer threads on a core than
exist on the core (or --hint=nomultithread which implies
--threads-per-core=1), the job will be unable to use those extra threads on
the core and those threads will not be included in the memory per CPU
calculation. But if the job has access to all threads on the core, those threads
will be included in the memory per CPU calculation even if the job did not
explicitly request those threads.
In the following examples, each core has two threads.
In this first example, two tasks can run on separate hyperthreads
in the same core because --threads-per-core is not used. The
third task uses both threads of the second core. The allocated
memory per cpu includes all threads:
```text
$ salloc -n3 --mem-per-cpu=100 salloc: Granted job allocation 17199 $ sacct -j $SLURM_JOB_ID -X -o jobid%7,reqtres%35,alloctres%35 JobID ReqTRES AllocTRES ------- ----------------------------------- ----------------------------------- 17199 billing=3,cpu=3,mem=300M,node=1 billing=4,cpu=4,mem=400M,node=1
```
In this second example, because of --threads-per-core=1, each
task is allocated an entire core but is only able to use one
thread per core. Allocated CPUs includes all threads on each
core. However, allocated memory per cpu includes only the
usable thread in each core.
```text
$ salloc -n3 --mem-per-cpu=100 --threads-per-core=1 salloc: Granted job allocation 17200 $ sacct -j $SLURM_JOB_ID -X -o jobid%7,reqtres%35,alloctres%35 JobID ReqTRES AllocTRES ------- ----------------------------------- ----------------------------------- 17200 billing=3,cpu=3,mem=300M,node=1 billing=6,cpu=6,mem=300M,node=1
```
DefMemPerGPU [#OPT_DefMemPerGPU](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Default real memory size available per allocated GPU in megabytes.
The default value is 0 (unlimited).
Please note a best effort attempt is made to predict which GPUs on the system
will be used, but this could change between job submission and start time,
causing MaxMemPerNode to potentially not work as expected for
heterogeneous jobs.
Also see DefMemPerCPU and DefMemPerNode .
DefMemPerCPU , DefMemPerGPU and DefMemPerNode are
mutually exclusive.
DefMemPerNode [#OPT_DefMemPerNode](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Default real memory size available per allocated node in megabytes.
Used to avoid over-subscribing memory and causing paging.
DefMemPerNode would generally be used if whole nodes
are allocated to jobs ( SelectType=select/linear ) and
resources are over-subscribed ( OverSubscribe=yes or
OverSubscribe=force ).
The default value is 0 (unlimited).
Also see DefMemPerCPU , DefMemPerGPU and MaxMemPerCPU .
DefMemPerCPU , DefMemPerGPU and DefMemPerNode are
mutually exclusive.
DependencyParameters [#OPT_DependencyParameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Multiple options may be comma separated.
disable_remote_singleton [#OPT_disable_remote_singleton](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) By default, when a federated job has a singleton dependency, each cluster in the
federation must clear the singleton dependency before the job's singleton
dependency is considered satisfied. Enabling this option means that only the
origin cluster must clear the singleton dependency. This option must be set
in every cluster in the federation.
kill_invalid_depend [#OPT_kill_invalid_depend](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If a job has an invalid dependency and it can never run terminate it
and set its state to be JOB_CANCELLED. By default the job stays pending
with reason DependencyNeverSatisfied.
max_depend_depth =#[#OPT_max_depend_depth](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Maximum number of jobs to test for a circular job dependency. Stop testing
after this number of job dependencies have been tested. The default value is
10 jobs.
DisableRootJobs [#OPT_DisableRootJobs](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set to "YES" then user root will be prevented from running any jobs.
The default value is "NO", meaning user root will be able to execute jobs.
DisableRootJobs may also be set by partition.
EioTimeout [#OPT_EioTimeout](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The number of seconds srun waits for slurmstepd to close the TCP/IP
connection used to relay data between the user application and srun
when the user application terminates. The default value is 60 seconds.
May not exceed 65533.
EnforcePartLimits [#OPT_EnforcePartLimits](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Controls whether partition limits are enforced when a job is submitted to the
cluster. The partition limits being considered by this option are its
configured MaxMemPerCPU, MaxMemPerNode, MinNodes, MaxNodes, MaxTime, AllocNodes,
AllowAccounts, AllowGroups, AllowQOS, and QOS usage threshold. It also considers
if the job requests more nodes than exist in the partition. If set, then a
job and job QOS cannot be submitted that exceed partition limits.
ALL [#OPT_ALL](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Jobs which exceed the number of nodes in a partition and/or any of its
configured limits will be rejected at submission time. If the job is submitted
to multiple partitions, the job must satisfy the limits on all the requested
partitions.
ANY [#OPT_ANY](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Jobs will be accepted if they satisfy the limits on at least one of the
requested partitions.
NO [#OPT_NO](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Partition limits will not be enforced at submit time, but will still be enforced
during scheduling. This includes jobs that request more nodes than exist in
any of the partition, so jobs can be submitted to empty partitions. A job that
exceeds the limits on all requested partitions will remain queued until the
partition limits are altered. This is the default.
Epilog [#OPT_Epilog](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Pathname of a script to execute as user root on every node when a user's job
completes (e.g. "/usr/local/slurm/epilog"). If it is not an absolute path name
(i.e. it does not start with a slash), it will be searched for in the same
directory as the slurm.conf file. A glob pattern (See glob (7)) may also
be used to run more than one epilog script (e.g. "/etc/slurm/epilog.d/*").
When more than one epilog script is configured, they are executed in reverse
alphabetical order (z-a -> Z-A -> 9-0). The Epilog script(s) may be used
to purge files, disable user login, etc.
By default there is no epilog.
See Prolog and Epilog Scripts for more information.
NOTE : It is possible to configure multiple epilog scripts by including
this option on multiple lines.
EpilogMsgTime [#OPT_EpilogMsgTime](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The number of microseconds that the slurmctld daemon requires to process
an epilog completion message from the slurmd daemons. This parameter can
be used to prevent a burst of epilog completion messages from being sent
at the same time which should help prevent lost messages and improve
throughput for large jobs.
The default value is 2000 microseconds.
For a 1000 node job, this spreads the epilog completion messages out over
two seconds.
EpilogSlurmctld [#OPT_EpilogSlurmctld](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Fully qualified pathname of a program for the slurmctld to execute
upon termination of a job allocation (e.g.
"/usr/local/slurm/epilog_controller").
The program executes as SlurmUser, which gives it permission to drain
nodes and requeue the job if a failure occurs (See [scontrol](https://slurm.schedmd.com/scontrol.html)(1)).
Exactly what the program does and how it accomplishes this is completely at
the discretion of the system administrator.
Information about the job being initiated, its allocated nodes, etc. are
passed to the program using environment variables.
See Prolog and Epilog Scripts for more information.
NOTE : It is possible to configure multiple epilog scripts by including
this option on multiple lines.
EpilogTimeout [#OPT_EpilogTimeout](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The interval in seconds Slurm waits for Epilog before terminating them. The
default value is PrologEpilogTimeout . This interval applies to the Epilog
run by slurmd daemon after the job, the EpilogSlurmctld run by slurmctld
daemon, and the SPANK plugin epilog call: slurm_spank_job_epilog.
If the Epilog or slurm_spank_job_epilog time out, the node is drained.
In all cases, errors are logged.
FairShareDampeningFactor [#OPT_FairShareDampeningFactor](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Dampen the effect of exceeding a user or group's fair share of allocated
resources. Higher values will provides greater ability to differentiate
between exceeding the fair share at high levels (e.g. a value of 1 results
in almost no difference between overconsumption by a factor of 10 and 100,
while a value of 5 will result in a significant difference in priority).
The default value is 1.
FederationParameters [#OPT_FederationParameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Used to define federation options. Multiple options may be comma separated.
fed_display [#OPT_fed_display](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, then the client status commands (e.g. squeue, sinfo, sprio, etc.) will
display information in a federated view by default. This option is functionally
equivalent to using the --federation options on each command. Use the client's
--local option to override the federated view and get a local view of the
given cluster.
Allow client commands to use the --cluster option even when the slurmdbd
is down by retrieving cluster records from slurmctld instead.
FirstJobId [#OPT_FirstJobId](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The job id to be used for the first job submitted to Slurm.
Job id values generated will incremented by 1 for each subsequent job.
Value must be larger than 0. The default value is 1.
Also see MaxJobId
GresTypes [#OPT_GresTypes](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) A comma-delimited list of generic resources to be managed (e.g.
GresTypes=gpu,mps ).
These resources may have an associated GRES plugin of the same name providing
additional functionality.
No generic resources are managed by default.
Ensure this parameter is consistent across all nodes in the cluster for
proper operation.
GroupUpdateForce [#OPT_GroupUpdateForce](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set to a non-zero value, then information about which users are members
of groups allowed to use a partition will be updated periodically, even when
there have been no changes to the /etc/group file.
If set to zero, group member information will be updated only after the
/etc/group file is updated.
The default value is 1.
Also see the GroupUpdateTime parameter.
GroupUpdateTime [#OPT_GroupUpdateTime](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Controls how frequently information about which users are members of
groups allowed to use a partition will be updated, and how long user
group membership lists will be cached.
The time interval is given in seconds with a default value of 600 seconds.
A value of zero will prevent periodic updating of group membership information.
Also see the GroupUpdateForce parameter.
GpuFreqDef =[< type ]= value >[,< type = value >][#OPT_GpuFreqDef](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Default GPU frequency to use when running a job step if it
has not been explicitly set using the --gpu-freq option.
This option can be used to independently configure the GPU and its memory
frequencies.
There is no default value. If unset, no attempt to change the GPU frequency
is made if the --gpu-freq option has not been set.
After the job is completed, the frequencies of all affected GPUs will be reset
to the highest possible values.
In some cases, system power caps may override the requested values.
The field type can be "memory".
If type is not specified, the GPU frequency is implied.
The value field can either be "low", "medium", "high", "highm1" or
a numeric value in megahertz (MHz).
If the specified numeric value is not possible, a value as close as
possible will be used.
See below for definition of the values.
Examples of use include "GpuFreqDef=medium,memory=high and "GpuFreqDef=450".
Supported value definitions:
low [#OPT_low](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) the lowest available frequency.
medium [#OPT_medium](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) attempts to set a frequency in the middle of the available range.
high [#OPT_high](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) the highest available frequency.
highm1 [#OPT_highm1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) (high minus one) will select the next highest available frequency.
HashPlugin [#OPT_HashPlugin](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Identifies the type of hash plugin to use for network communication.
Acceptable values include:
hash/k12 [#OPT_hash/k12](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Hashes are generated by the KangorooTwelve cryptographic hash function.
This is the default.
hash/sha3 [#OPT_hash/sha3](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Hashes are generated by the SHA-3 cryptographic hash function.
NOTE : Make sure that HashPlugin has the same value both in slurm.conf
and in slurmdbd.conf.
HealthCheckInterval [#OPT_HealthCheckInterval](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The interval in seconds between executions of HealthCheckProgram .
The default value is zero, which disables execution.
HealthCheckNodeState [#OPT_HealthCheckNodeState](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Identify what node states should execute the HealthCheckProgram .
Multiple state values may be specified with a comma separator.
The default value is ANY to execute on nodes in any state.
ALLOC [#OPT_ALLOC](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Run on nodes in the ALLOC state (all CPUs allocated).
ANY [#OPT_ANY_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Run on nodes in any state.
CYCLE [#OPT_CYCLE](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Rather than running the health check program on all nodes at the same time,
cycle through running on all compute nodes through the course of the
HealthCheckInterval . May be combined with the various node state
options.
IDLE [#OPT_IDLE](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Run on nodes in the IDLE state.
NONDRAINED_IDLE [#OPT_NONDRAINED_IDLE](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Run on nodes that are in the IDLE state and not DRAINED.
MIXED [#OPT_MIXED](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Run on nodes in the MIXED state (some CPUs idle and other CPUs allocated).
START_ONLY [#OPT_START_ONLY](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Run only at slurmd startup.
HealthCheckProgram [#OPT_HealthCheckProgram](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Fully qualified pathname of a script to execute as user root periodically
on all compute nodes that are not in the NOT_RESPONDING state. This
program may be used to verify the node is fully operational and DRAIN the node
or send email if a problem is detected.
Any action to be taken must be explicitly performed by the program
(e.g. execute
"scontrol update NodeName=foo State=drain Reason=tmp_file_system_full"
to drain a node).
The execution interval is controlled using the HealthCheckInterval
parameter.
Note that the HealthCheckProgram will be executed at the same time
on all nodes to minimize its impact upon parallel programs.
This program will be killed if it does not terminate normally within
60 seconds.
This program will also be executed when the slurmd daemon is first started and
before it registers with the slurmctld daemon. If HealthCheckNodeState is
START_ONLY it will be executed only when the slurmd daemon is first
started.
By default, no program will be executed.
HttpParserType [#OPT_HttpParserType](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specify the http_parser implementation that will be used. Default is
http_parser/libhttp_parser .
Acceptable values at present:
http_parser/libhttp_parser [#OPT_http_parser/libhttp_parser](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Use the libhttp_parser based plugin.
InactiveLimit [#OPT_InactiveLimit](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The interval, in seconds, after which a non-responsive job allocation
command (e.g. srun or salloc ) will result in the job being
terminated. If the node on which the command is executed fails or the
command abnormally terminates, this will terminate its job allocation.
This option has no effect upon batch jobs.
When setting a value, take into consideration that a debugger using srun
to launch an application may leave the srun command in a stopped state
for extended periods of time.
This limit is ignored for jobs running in partitions with the
RootOnly flag set (the scheduler running as root will be
responsible for the job).
The default value is unlimited (zero) and may not exceed 65533 seconds.
InteractiveStepOptions [#OPT_InteractiveStepOptions](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) When LaunchParameters=use_interactive_step is enabled, launching salloc will
automatically start an srun process with InteractiveStepOptions to launch
a terminal on a node in the job allocation.
The default value is "--interactive --preserve-env --pty $SHELL".
The "--interactive" option is intentionally not documented in the srun man
page. It is meant only to be used in InteractiveStepOptions in order to
create an "interactive step" that will not consume resources so that other
steps may run in parallel with the interactive step.
JobAcctGatherType [#OPT_JobAcctGatherType](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The JobAcctGather plugin collects memory, cpu, io, interconnect, energy and gpu
usage information at the task level, depending on which plugins are configured
in Slurm. This parameter will control how some of these metrics will be
collected. Unset by default.
Configurable values at present are:
jobacct_gather/cgroup (recommended)[#OPT_jobacct_gather/cgroup](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Collect cpu and memory statistics by reading the task's cgroup directory
interfaces (e.g. memory.stat, cpu.stat) by issuing a call to the configured
CgroupPlugin (see "man cgroup.conf").
This mechanism ignores JobAcctGatherParams=UsePSS or NoShared since these are
used only when reading memory usage from the proc filesystem.
jobacct_gather/linux [#OPT_jobacct_gather/linux](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Collect cpu and memory statistics by reading procfs. The plugin will take all
the pids of the task and for each of them will read /proc/<pid>/stats. If UsePSS
is set it will also read /proc/<pid>/smaps, and if NoShare is set it will also
read /proc/<pid>/statm (see JobAcctGatherParams for more information).
This plugin carries a performance penalty on jobs with a large number of spawned
processes since it needs to iterate over all the task pids and aggregate the
stats into one single metric for the ppid, and then these values need to be
aggregated to the task stats.
NOTE : Changing the plugin type when jobs are running in the cluster is
possible. The already running steps will keep using the previous plugin
mechanism, while new steps will use the new mechanism.
JobAcctGatherFrequency [#OPT_JobAcctGatherFrequency](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The job accounting and profiling sampling intervals, specified for each data
type. Multiple comma-separated <datatype>=<interval> intervals may be
specified. If an interval is provided without a datatype, it will be assigned
to the task datatype. Supported datatypes are as follows:
Affects accounting and profiling:
task =< interval >[#OPT_task](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) sampling interval in seconds for task usage by the jobacct_gather plugins and
for task profiling by the acct_gather_profile plugin.
Defaults to 30.
If this interval is 0 (disabled), accounting information is collected only at
job termination, which reduces Slurm
interference with the job, but also means that the statistics about a job
are only derived from a single sample and don't reflect the average or maximum
of several samples throughout the life of the job.
Affects profiling only:
energy =< interval >[#OPT_energy](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) sampling interval in seconds for energy profiling using the acct_gather_energy
plugin. Defaults to 0 (disabled).
network =< interval >[#OPT_network](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) sampling interval in seconds for infiniband profiling using the
acct_gather_interconnect plugin. Defaults to 0 (disabled).
filesystem =< interval >[#OPT_filesystem](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) sampling interval in seconds for filesystem profiling using the
acct_gather_filesystem plugin. Defaults to 0 (disabled).
Smaller (non-zero) values have a greater impact upon job performance,
but a value of 30 seconds is not likely to be noticeable for
applications having less than 10,000 tasks.
Users can independently override each interval on a per job basis using the
--acctg-freq option when submitting the job.
This value should be lower or equal to EnergyIPMIFreq when using
acct_gather_energy/ipmi or xcc plugins as otherwise it will unnecessarily
get repeated values on successive polls.
JobAcctGatherParams [#OPT_JobAcctGatherParams](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Arbitrary parameters for the job account gather plugin.
Acceptable values at present include:
DisableGPUAcct [#OPT_DisableGPUAcct](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Do not do accounting of GPU usage and skip any gpu driver library call. This
parameter can help to improve performance if the GPU driver response is slow.
no_file_cache [#OPT_no_file_cache](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Filesystem-backed memory (active_file and inactive_file) will be subtracted
from the reported memory. This disables the use of the memory.peak interface,
which can result in MaxRSS failing to record short memory spikes.
Only compatible with cgroup/v2 plugin.
NoShared [#OPT_NoShared](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Exclude shared memory from RSS. This option cannot be used with UsePSS.
Only compatible with jobacct_gather/linux plugin.
OverMemoryKill [#OPT_OverMemoryKill](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Kill processes that are being detected to use more memory than requested by
steps every time accounting information is gathered by the JobAcctGather plugin.
This parameter should be used with caution because a job exceeding its memory
allocation may affect other processes and/or machine health.
NOTE : If available, it is recommended to limit memory by enabling
task/cgroup as a TaskPlugin and making use of ConstrainRAMSpace=yes in the
cgroup.conf instead of using this JobAcctGather mechanism for memory
enforcement. Using JobAcctGather is polling based and there is a
delay before a job is killed, which could lead to system Out of Memory events.
NOTE : When using OverMemoryKill , if the combined memory used by
all the processes in a step exceeds the memory limit, the entire step will be
killed/cancelled by the JobAcctGather plugin.
This differs from the behavior when using ConstrainRAMSpace , where
processes in the step will be killed, but the step will be left active,
possibly with other processes left running.
UsePss [#OPT_UsePss](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Use PSS value instead of RSS to calculate real usage of memory. The PSS value
will be saved as RSS. This option cannot be used with NoShared. Only compatible
with jobacct_gather/linux plugin.
JobCompHost [#OPT_JobCompHost](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The name of the machine hosting the job completion database.
Only used for database type storage plugins, ignored otherwise.
JobCompLoc [#OPT_JobCompLoc](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) This option sets a string which has different meanings depending on
JobCompType :
If jobcomp/elasticsearch :
Instructs this plugin to send the finished job records information to the
Elasticsearch server URL endpoint (including the port number and the target
index) configured in this option. This string should typically take the form
of <host>:<port>/<target>/_doc . There is no default value for
JobCompLoc when this plugin is enabled.
NOTE : Refer to <[https://slurm.schedmd.com/elasticsearch.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/elasticsearch.html)> for more
information.
If jobcomp/filetxt :
Instructs this plugin to send the finished job records information to a file
configured in this option. This string should represent an absolute path to
a file. The default value for this plugin is /var/log/slurm_jobcomp.log .
If jobcomp/kafka :
When this plugin is configured, finished (and optionally start running) job
records information is sent to a Kafka server. The plugin makes use of
librdkafka . This string represents an absolute path to a file containing
key=value pairs configuring the library behavior. For the plugin to work
properly, this file needs to exist and least the bootstrap.servers
librdkafka property needs to be configured in it. There is no default
value for JobCompLoc when this plugin is enabled.
NOTE : For a full list of librdkafka properties, please refer to
the library documentation. You can also view the jobcomp_kafka page for more
information: <[https://slurm.schedmd.com/jobcomp_kafka.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/jobcomp_kafka.html)>
NOTE : The target Kafka topic(s) and other plugin parameters can be
configured via JobCompParams .
If jobcomp/lua :
This option is ignored in this plugin. The finished job record is processed
by a hardcoded jobcomp.lua script expected to be located in the same
location of slurm.conf. There is no default value for JobCompLoc when this
plugin is enabled.
If jobcomp/mysql :
Instructs this plugin to send the finished job records information to a database
name configured in this option. This string should represent a database name.
The default value for this plugin is slurm_jobcomp_db .
If jobcomp/script :
The finished job record information is made available via environment variables
and processed by a script with name configured by this option. This string
should represent a path to a script. There is no default value for JobCompLoc
when this plugin is enabled. It needs to be explicitly configured or the
plugin will fail to initialize.
JobCompParams [#OPT_JobCompParams](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Pass arbitrary text string to job completion plugin.
Also see JobCompType .
Optional comma-separated list for jobcomp/elasticsearch :
send_script [#OPT_send_script](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Sends the job script as part of jobcomp messages.
Optional comma-separated list for jobcomp/kafka :
enable_job_start [#OPT_enable_job_start](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Instruct the jobcomp/kafka plugin to send a subset of the job record
fields to the topic_job_start Kafka topic when a job first starts running.
NOTE : The writing when the job finishes (historical purpose of the plugin)
is always enabled by default and can't be disabled.
NOTE : The subset of fields for job start events is slightly smaller than
those sent when the job finishes.
flush_timeout =<milliseconds>[#OPT_flush_timeout](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for all outstanding produce requests,
et.al, to be completed. This is passed as a timeout argument to the
librdkafka flush API function, called on plugin termination. This is done
prior to destroying the producer instance to make sure all queued and in-flight
produce requests are completed before terminating.
For non-blocking calls, set to 0.
To wait indefinitely for an event, set to -1 (not recommended, since this is
called on plugin fini and could block slurmctld graceful termination).
Accepted values are [-1,2147483647].
Defaults to 500 (milliseconds).
poll_interval =<seconds>[#OPT_poll_interval](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Seconds between calls to librdkafka API poll function, which polls the
provided Kafka handle for events. The plugin spawns a separate thread to perform
this call at the configured interval.
Accepted values are [0,4294967295].
Defaults to 2 (seconds).
requeue_on_msg_timeout [#OPT_requeue_on_msg_timeout](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Instruct the delivery report callback to requeue messages that failed delivery
because their time waiting for successful delivery reached the librdkafka
property message.timeout.ms .
Defaults to not set (don't requeue and thus discard these messages).
send_script [#OPT_send_script_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Sends the job script as part of jobcomp messages.
topic =<string>[#OPT_topic](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Target Kafka topic to send messages to when a job finishes.
Defaults to ClusterName .
topic_job_start =<string>[#OPT_topic_job_start](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Target Kafka topic to send messages to when a job starts running.
Defaults to <ClusterName>-job-start .
NOTE : It is advisable that job start running event records be sent to a
different Kafka topic than the topic configured for job finish event records.
Optional comma-separated list for jobcomp/mysql :
token_duration [#OPT_token_duration](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Duration in seconds to cache generated database passwords before requesting a
new one from the StoragePassScript. Typically the token should refresh prior
to actual expiration; upon token generation failure the cached token will
continue to be used to avoid transient generation failures from causing
connection failures.
Default value is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
JobCompPass [#OPT_JobCompPass](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The password used to gain access to the database to store the job
completion data.
Only used for database type storage plugins, ignored otherwise.
JobCompPassScript [#OPT_JobCompPassScript](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Absolute path to an executable script that generates ephemeral authentication
tokens for database connections which are used instead of JobCompPass .
The script must output the password/token to stdout and exit with status 0 on
success. This allows dynamic password generation, instead of storing static
credentials in configuration files.
The script must be owned and executable by SlurmUser.
Environment variables provided to the script:
SLURM_STORAGE_HOSTNAME [#OPT_SLURM_STORAGE_HOSTNAME](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Database hostname
SLURM_STORAGE_PORT [#OPT_SLURM_STORAGE_PORT](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Database port number
SLURM_STORAGE_USER [#OPT_SLURM_STORAGE_USER](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Database username
Expected output format:
TOKEN= <authentication_token>
The script must exit with status 0 on success, non-zero on failure.
Any output to stderr will be logged as an error. If there is a backup
host specified, the script will still be provided the main hostname and
the same token is used for both hosts.
JobCompPort [#OPT_JobCompPort](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The listening port of the job completion database server.
Only used for database type storage plugins, ignored otherwise.
JobCompType [#OPT_JobCompType](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The job completion logging mechanism type. Unset by default.
Acceptable values at present include:
jobcomp/elasticsearch [#OPT_jobcomp/elasticsearch](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Upon job completion, a record of the job should be written to an
Elasticsearch server, specified by the JobCompLoc parameter.
NOTE : More information is available at the Slurm web site
( [https://slurm.schedmd.com/elasticsearch.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/elasticsearch.html) ).
jobcomp/filetxt [#OPT_jobcomp/filetxt](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Upon job completion, a record of the job should be written to a text file,
specified by the JobCompLoc parameter.
jobcomp/kafka [#OPT_jobcomp/kafka](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Upon job completion (or optionally job start running), a record of the job
should be sent to a Kafka server, specified by the file path referenced in
JobCompLoc and/or using other JobCompParams .
jobcomp/lua [#OPT_jobcomp/lua](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Upon job completion, a record of the job should be processed by the
jobcomp.lua script, located in the default script directory
(typically the subdirectory etc of the installation directory.
jobcomp/mysql [#OPT_jobcomp/mysql](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Upon job completion, a record of the job should be written to a MySQL
or MariaDB database, specified by the JobCompLoc parameter.
jobcomp/script [#OPT_jobcomp/script](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Upon job completion, a script specified by the JobCompLoc parameter is
to be executed with environment variables providing the job information.
JobCompUser [#OPT_JobCompUser](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The user account for accessing the job completion database.
Only used for database type storage plugins, ignored otherwise.
JobFileAppend [#OPT_JobFileAppend](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) This option controls what to do if a job's output or error file
exist when the job is started.
If JobFileAppend is set to a value of 1, then append to
the existing file.
By default, any existing file is truncated.
JobRequeue [#OPT_JobRequeue](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) This option controls the default ability for batch jobs to be requeued.
Jobs may be requeued explicitly by a system administrator, after node
failure, or upon preemption by a higher priority job.
If JobRequeue is set to a value of 1, then batch jobs may be requeued
unless explicitly disabled by the user.
If JobRequeue is set to a value of 0, then batch jobs will not be requeued
unless explicitly enabled by the user.
Use the sbatch --no-requeue or --requeue
option to change the default behavior for individual jobs.
The default value is 1.
JobSubmitPlugins [#OPT_JobSubmitPlugins](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) These are intended to be site-specific plugins which can be used to set
default job parameters and/or logging events. Slurm can be configured to use
multiple job_submit plugins if desired, which must be specified as a
comma-delimited list and will be executed in the order listed.
```text
e.g. for multiple job_submit plugin configuration: JobSubmitPlugins=lua,require_timelimit
```
Take a look at <[https://slurm.schedmd.com/job_submit_plugins.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/job_submit_plugins.html)> for further
plugin implementation details. No job submission plugins are used by default.
Currently available plugins are:
all_partitions [#OPT_all_partitions](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Set default partition to all partitions on the cluster.
defaults [#OPT_defaults](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Set default values for job submission or modify requests.
logging [#OPT_logging](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Log select job submission and modification parameters.
lua [#OPT_lua](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Execute a Lua script implementing site's own job_submit logic. Only one Lua
script will be executed. It must be named "job_submit.lua" and must be located
in the default configuration directory (typically the subdirectory "etc" of the
installation directory). Sample Lua scripts can be found with the Slurm
distribution, in the directory contribs/lua. Slurmctld will fatal on startup if
the configured lua script is invalid. Slurm will try to load the script for each
job submission. If the script is broken or removed while slurmctld is running,
Slurm will fallback to the previous working version of the script.
Warning : slurmctld runs this script while holding internal locks, and
only a single copy of this script can run at a time. This blocks most
concurrency in slurmctld. Therefore, this script should run to completion as
quickly as possible.
partition [#OPT_partition](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Set a job's default partition based upon job submission parameters and
available partitions.
pbs [#OPT_pbs](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Translate PBS job submission options to Slurm equivalent (if possible).
require_timelimit [#OPT_require_timelimit](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Force job submissions to specify a timelimit.
NOTE : For examples of use see the Slurm code in "src/plugins/job_submit"
and "contribs/lua/job_submit*.lua" then modify the code to satisfy your needs.
KillOnBadExit [#OPT_KillOnBadExit](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set to 1, a step will be terminated immediately if any task is
crashed or aborted, as indicated by a non-zero exit code.
With the default value of 0, if one of the processes is crashed or aborted
the other processes will continue to run while the crashed or aborted process
waits. The user can override this configuration parameter by using srun's
-K , --kill-on-bad-exit .
KillWait [#OPT_KillWait](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The interval, in seconds, given to a job's processes between the
SIGTERM and SIGKILL signals upon reaching its time limit.
If the job fails to terminate gracefully in the interval specified,
it will be forcibly terminated.
The default value is 30 seconds.
The value may not exceed 65533.
MaxBatchRequeue [#OPT_MaxBatchRequeue](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Maximum number of times a batch job may be automatically requeued before
being marked as JobHeldAdmin. (Mainly useful when the SchedulerParameters
option nohold_on_prolog_fail is enabled.)
The default value is 5.
NodeFeaturesPlugins [#OPT_NodeFeaturesPlugins](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Identifies the plugins to be used for support of node features which can
change through time. For example, a node which might be booted with various
BIOS setting. This is supported through the use of a node's active_features
and available_features information.
Acceptable values at present include:
node_features/helpers [#OPT_node_features/helpers](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Used to report and modify features on nodes using arbitrary scripts or
programs.
See helpers.conf man page for more information:
[https://slurm.schedmd.com/helpers.conf.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/helpers.conf.html)
LaunchParameters [#OPT_LaunchParameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Identifies options to the job launch plugin.
Acceptable values include:
batch_step_set_cpu_freq [#OPT_batch_step_set_cpu_freq](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Set the cpu frequency for the batch step from given --cpu-freq, or
slurm.conf CpuFreqDef, option. By default only steps started with srun will
utilize the cpu freq setting options.
NOTE : If you are using srun to launch your steps inside a batch script
(advised) this option will create a situation where you may have multiple
agents setting the cpu_freq as the batch step usually runs on the same
resources one or more steps the sruns in the script will create.
interactive_step_set_cpu_freq [#OPT_interactive_step_set_cpu_freq](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Set the cpu frequency for the interactive step from given --cpu-freq, or
slurm.conf CpuFreqDef, options.
cray_net_exclusive [#OPT_cray_net_exclusive](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Allow jobs on a Cray XC cluster exclusive access to network resources.
This should only be set on clusters providing exclusive access to each
node to a single job at once, and not using parallel steps within the job,
otherwise resources on the node can be oversubscribed.
enable_nss_slurm [#OPT_enable_nss_slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Permits passwd and group resolution for a job to be serviced by slurmstepd rather
than requiring a lookup from a network based service. See
[https://slurm.schedmd.com/nss_slurm.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/nss_slurm.html) for more information.
lustre_no_flush [#OPT_lustre_no_flush](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set on a Cray XC cluster, then do not flush the Lustre cache on job step
completion. This setting will only take effect after reconfiguring, and will
only take effect for newly launched jobs.
mem_sort [#OPT_mem_sort](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Sort NUMA memory at step start. User can override this default with
SLURM_MEM_BIND environment variable or --mem-bind=nosort command line option.
mpir_use_nodeaddr [#OPT_mpir_use_nodeaddr](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) When launching tasks Slurm creates entries in MPIR_proctable that are used by
parallel debuggers, profilers, and related tools to attach to running process.
By default the MPIR_proctable entries contain MPIR_procdesc structures where
the host_name is set to NodeName by default. If this option is specified,
NodeAddr will be used in this context instead.
disable_send_gids [#OPT_disable_send_gids](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) By default, the slurmctld will look up and send the user_name and extended gids
for a job, rather than independently on each node as part of each task launch.
This helps mitigate issues around name service scalability when launching jobs
involving many nodes. Using this option will disable this functionality. This
option is ignored if enable_nss_slurm is specified.
slurmstepd_memlock [#OPT_slurmstepd_memlock](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Lock the slurmstepd process's current memory in RAM.
slurmstepd_memlock_all [#OPT_slurmstepd_memlock_all](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Lock the slurmstepd process's current and future memory in RAM.
test_exec [#OPT_test_exec](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Have srun verify existence of the executable program along with user
execute permission on the node where srun was called before attempting to
launch it on nodes in the step.
use_interactive_step [#OPT_use_interactive_step](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Have salloc use the Interactive Step to launch a shell on an allocated compute
node rather than locally to wherever salloc was invoked. This is accomplished
by launching the srun command with InteractiveStepOptions as options.
This does not affect salloc called with a command as an argument. These jobs
will continue to be executed as the calling user on the calling host.
ulimit_pam_adopt [#OPT_ulimit_pam_adopt](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) When pam_slurm_adopt is used to join an external process into a job cgroup,
RLIMIT_RSS is set, as is done for tasks running in regular steps.
Licenses [#OPT_Licenses](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specification of licenses (or other resources available on all
nodes of the cluster) which can be allocated to jobs.
License names can optionally be followed by a colon
and count with a default count of one.
Multiple license names should be comma separated (e.g.
"Licenses=foo:4,bar").
Note that Slurm prevents jobs from being scheduled if their
required license specification is not available.
Slurm does not prevent jobs from using licenses that are
not explicitly listed in the job submission specification.
LogTimeFormat [#OPT_LogTimeFormat](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Format of the timestamp in slurmctld and slurmd log files. Accepted
format values include "iso8601", "iso8601_ms", "rfc5424", "rfc5424_ms",
"rfc3339", "clock", "short" and "thread_id". The values ending in "_ms" differ
from the ones without in that fractional seconds with millisecond precision are
printed. The default value is "iso8601_ms". The "rfc5424" formats are the same
as the "iso8601" formats except that the timezone value is also shown.
The "clock" format shows a timestamp in microseconds retrieved
with the C standard clock() function. The "short" format is a short
date and time format. The "thread_id" format shows the timestamp
in the C standard ctime() function form without the year but
including the microseconds, the daemon's process ID and the current thread name
and ID.
MailDomain [#OPT_MailDomain](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Domain name to qualify usernames if email address is not explicitly given
with the "--mail-user" option. If unset, the local MTA will need to qualify
local address itself. Changes to MailDomain will only affect new jobs.
MailProg [#OPT_MailProg](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Fully qualified pathname to the program used to send email per user request.
The default value is "/bin/mail" (or "/usr/bin/mail" if "/bin/mail" does not
exist but "/usr/bin/mail" does exist).
The program is called with arguments suitable for the default mail command,
however additional information about the job is passed in the form of
environment variables.
Additional variables are the same as those passed to PrologSlurmctld and
EpilogSlurmctld with additional variables in the following contexts:
ALL [#OPT_ALL_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html)
SLURM_JOB_STATE [#OPT_SLURM_JOB_STATE](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The base state of the job when the MailProg is called.
SLURM_JOB_MAIL_TYPE [#OPT_SLURM_JOB_MAIL_TYPE](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The mail type triggering the mail.
BEGIN [#OPT_BEGIN](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html)
SLURM_JOB_QEUEUED_TIME [#OPT_SLURM_JOB_QEUEUED_TIME](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The amount of time the job was queued.
END, FAIL, REQUEUE, TIME_LIMIT_* [#OPT_END,-FAIL,-REQUEUE,-TIME_LIMIT_*](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html)
SLURM_JOB_RUN_TIME [#OPT_SLURM_JOB_RUN_TIME](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The amount of time the job ran for.
END, FAIL [#OPT_END,-FAIL](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html)
SLURM_JOB_EXIT_CODE_MAX [#OPT_SLURM_JOB_EXIT_CODE_MAX](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Job's exit code or highest exit code for an array job.
SLURM_JOB_EXIT_CODE_MIN [#OPT_SLURM_JOB_EXIT_CODE_MIN](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Job's minimum exit code for an array job.
SLURM_JOB_TERM_SIGNAL_MAX [#OPT_SLURM_JOB_TERM_SIGNAL_MAX](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Job's highest signal for an array job.
STAGE_OUT [#OPT_STAGE_OUT](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html)
SLURM_JOB_STAGE_OUT_TIME [#OPT_SLURM_JOB_STAGE_OUT_TIME](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Job's staging out time.
MaxArraySize [#OPT_MaxArraySize](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum job array task index value will be one less than MaxArraySize
to allow for an index value of zero.
Configure MaxArraySize to 0 in order to disable job array use.
The value may not exceed 4000001.
The value of MaxJobCount should be much larger than MaxArraySize ,
since each job array task still counts as a separate job (see MaxJobCount
for further details).
The default value is 1001.
See also max_array_tasks in SchedulerParameters.
MaxDBDMsgs [#OPT_MaxDBDMsgs](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) When communication to the SlurmDBD is not possible the slurmctld will queue
messages meant to processed when the SlurmDBD is available again.
In order to avoid running out of memory the slurmctld will only queue so many
messages. The default value is 10000, or MaxJobCount * 2 + Node Count
* 4, whichever is greater. The value can not be less than 10000.
MaxJobCount [#OPT_MaxJobCount](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum number of jobs slurmctld can have in memory at one time.
Combine with MinJobAge to ensure the slurmctld daemon does not exhaust
its memory or other resources. Once this limit is reached, requests to submit
additional jobs will fail. The default value is 10000 jobs.
NOTE : Each task of a job array counts as one job even though they will not
occupy separate job records until modified or initiated.
Performance can suffer with more than a few hundred thousand jobs.
Setting MaxSubmitJobs per user is generally valuable to prevent a single
user from filling the system with jobs.
This is accomplished using Slurm's database and configuring enforcement of
resource limits.
MaxJobId [#OPT_MaxJobId](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum job id to be used for jobs submitted to Slurm without a specific
requested value. Job ids are unsigned 32bit integers with the first 26 bits
reserved for local job ids and the remaining 6 bits reserved for a cluster id
to identify a federated job's origin. The maximum allowed local job id is
67,108,863 (0x3FFFFFF). The default value is 67,043,328 (0x03ff0000).
MaxJobId only applies to the local job id and not the federated job id.
Job id values generated will be incremented by 1 for each subsequent job. Once
MaxJobId is reached, the next job will be assigned FirstJobId .
Federated jobs will always have a job ID of 67,108,865 or higher.
Also see FirstJobId .
MaxMemPerCPU [#OPT_MaxMemPerCPU](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Maximum real memory size available per allocated CPU in megabytes.
Used to avoid over-subscribing memory and causing paging.
MaxMemPerCPU would generally be used if individual processors
are allocated to jobs ( SelectType=select/cons_tres ).
The default value is 0 (unlimited).
Also see DefMemPerCPU , DefMemPerGPU and MaxMemPerNode .
MaxMemPerCPU and MaxMemPerNode are mutually exclusive.
NOTE : If a job specifies a memory per CPU limit that exceeds this system
limit, that job's count of CPUs per task will try to automatically increase.
This may result in the job failing due to CPU count limits. This
auto-adjustment feature is a best-effort one and optimal assignment is not
guaranteed due to the possibility of having heterogeneous configurations and
multi-partition/qos jobs. If this is a concern it is advised to use a job
submit LUA plugin instead to enforce auto-adjustments to your specific needs.
MaxMemPerNode [#OPT_MaxMemPerNode](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Maximum real memory size available per allocated node in a job allocation in
megabytes. Used to avoid over-subscribing memory and causing paging.
MaxMemPerNode would generally be used if whole nodes
are allocated to jobs ( SelectType=select/linear ) and
resources are over-subscribed ( OverSubscribe=yes or
OverSubscribe=force ).
The default value is 0 (unlimited).
Also see DefMemPerNode and MaxMemPerCPU .
MaxMemPerCPU and MaxMemPerNode are mutually exclusive.
MaxNodeCount [#OPT_MaxNodeCount](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Maximum count of nodes which may exist in the controller. By default MaxNodeCount
will be set to the number of nodes found in the slurm.conf. MaxNodeCount will
be ignored if less than the number of nodes found in the
slurm.conf. The total number of nodes in a system cannot exceed 65536. Increase
MaxNodeCount to accommodate dynamically created nodes with dynamic node
registrations and nodes created with scontrol.
MaxStepCount [#OPT_MaxStepCount](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum number of steps that any job can initiate. This parameter
is intended to limit the effect of bad batch scripts.
The default value is 40000 steps.
MaxTasksPerNode [#OPT_MaxTasksPerNode](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Maximum number of tasks Slurm will allow a job step to spawn
on a single node. The default MaxTasksPerNode is 512.
May not exceed 65533.
MCSParameters [#OPT_MCSParameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) MCS = Multi-Category Security
MCS Plugin Parameters.
The supported parameters are specific to the MCSPlugin .
Changes to this value take effect when the Slurm daemons are reconfigured.
More information about MCS is available here
<[https://slurm.schedmd.com/mcs.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/mcs.html)>.
MCSPlugin [#OPT_MCSPlugin](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) MCS = Multi-Category Security : associate a security label to jobs and ensure
that nodes can only be shared among jobs using the same security label.
Unset by default. Acceptable values include:
mcs/account [#OPT_mcs/account](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) only users with the same account can share the nodes (requires enabling of accounting).
mcs/group [#OPT_mcs/group](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) only users with the same group can share the nodes.
mcs/user [#OPT_mcs/user](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) a node cannot be shared with other users.
mcs/label [#OPT_mcs/label](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) only jobs with the same arbitrary label string can share nodes.
MessageTimeout [#OPT_MessageTimeout](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Time permitted for a round-trip communication to complete
in seconds. Default value is 10 seconds. For systems with
shared nodes, the slurmd daemon could be paged out and
necessitate higher values.
MetricsType [#OPT_MetricsType](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specify the metrics plugin to be used to dump statistics from the slurmctld
socket. Gathering of metrics is disabled when PrivateData is set. Refer to the
Metrics Guide for further details: <[https://slurm.schedmd.com/metrics.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/metrics.html)>
Configurable values at present are:
metrics/openmetrics [#OPT_metrics/openmetrics](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Use the OpenMetrics based plugin.
MinJobAge [#OPT_MinJobAge](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The minimum age of a completed job before its record is cleared from the list
of jobs slurmctld keeps in memory. Combine with MaxJobCount
to ensure the slurmctld daemon does not exhaust
its memory or other resources. The default value is 300 seconds.
A value of zero prevents any job record purging.
Jobs are not purged during a backfill cycle, so it can take longer than
MinJobAge seconds to purge a job if using the backfill scheduling plugin.
In order to eliminate some possible race conditions, the minimum non-zero
value for MinJobAge recommended is 2.
MpiDefault [#OPT_MpiDefault](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Identifies the default type of MPI to be used.
Unset by default, which allows Slurm to work with versions of MPI other than
listed below.
Srun may override this configuration parameter in any case.
Currently supported versions include:
pmi2 and pmix .
More information about MPI use is available here
[mpi_guide](https://slurm.schedmd.com/mpi_guide.html).
MpiParams [#OPT_MpiParams](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) MPI-related parameters. Multiple parameters may be comma separated. Currently
supported parameters include:
ports =#-#[#OPT_ports](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Identifies a range of communication ports used by native Cray's PMI.
disable_slurm_hydra_bootstrap [#OPT_disable_slurm_hydra_bootstrap](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Disable environment variable injection in allocations for the following
variables: I_MPI_HYDRA_BOOTSTRAP, I_MPI_HYDRA_BOOTSTRAP_EXEC_EXTRA_ARGS,
HYDRA_BOOTSTRAP, HYDRA_LAUNCHER_EXTRA_ARGS.
Manually setting I_MPI_HYDRA_BOOTSTRAP or HYDRA_BOOTSTRAP to 'slurm' in the
allocation will skip this parameter and injection of extra args will be
performed as usual.
NamespaceType [#OPT_NamespaceType](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Identifies the plugin to be used for job isolation through namespaces. To use
these plugins, 'PrologFlags=Contain' must be set. Refer to the namespace page
for further details: <[https://slurm.schedmd.com/namespace.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/namespace.html)>
NOTE : See ProctrackType for resource containment and usage tracking.
Acceptable values at present include:
namespace/linux [#OPT_namespace/linux](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Used to create a private filesystem namespace and optionally user and pid
namespaces. The filesystem namespace houses temporary filesystems (/tmp and
/dev/shm) for each job.
NOTE : This plugin requires cgroup/v2 to operate correctly.
NOTE : When using user namespaces, bpf token support (added in kernel 6.9)
is required to use ConstrainDevices in cgroup.conf .
namespace/tmpfs [#OPT_namespace/tmpfs](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Used to create a private namespace on the filesystem for jobs, which houses
temporary file systems (/tmp and /dev/shm) for each job.
OverTimeLimit [#OPT_OverTimeLimit](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Number of minutes by which a job can exceed its time limit before
being canceled.
Normally a job's time limit is treated as a hard limit and the job will be
killed upon reaching that limit.
Configuring OverTimeLimit will result in the job's time limit being
treated like a soft limit.
Adding the OverTimeLimit value to the soft time limit provides a
hard time limit, at which point the job is canceled.
This is particularly useful for backfill scheduling, which bases upon
each job's soft time limit.
The default value is zero.
May not exceed 65533 minutes.
A value of "UNLIMITED" is also supported.
PluginDir [#OPT_PluginDir](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Identifies the places in which to look for Slurm plugins.
This is a colon-separated list of directories, like the PATH
environment variable.
The default value is the prefix given at configure time + "/lib/slurm".
PlugStackConfig [#OPT_PlugStackConfig](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Location of the config file for Slurm stackable plugins that use
the Stackable Plugin Architecture for Node job (K)control (SPANK).
This provides support for a highly configurable set of plugins to
be called before and/or after execution of each task spawned as
part of a user's job step. Default location is "plugstack.conf"
in the same directory as the system slurm.conf. For more information
on SPANK plugins, see the [spank](https://slurm.schedmd.com/spank.html) (8) manual.
PreemptMode [#OPT_PreemptMode](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Mechanism used to preempt jobs or enable gang scheduling. When the
PreemptType parameter is set to enable preemption, the
PreemptMode selects the default mechanism used to preempt the eligible
jobs for the cluster.
PreemptMode may be specified on a per partition basis to override this
default value if PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio . Alternatively, it
can be specified on a per QOS basis if PreemptType=preempt/qos . In either
case, a valid default PreemptMode value must be specified for the
cluster as a whole when preemption is enabled.
The GANG option is used to enable gang scheduling independent of
whether preemption is enabled (i.e. independent of the PreemptType
setting). It can be specified in addition to a PreemptMode setting with
the two options comma separated (e.g. PreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG ).
See <[preempt](https://slurm.schedmd.com/preempt.html)> and
<[gang_scheduling](https://slurm.schedmd.com/gang_scheduling.html)> for more details.
NOTE :
For performance reasons, the backfill scheduler reserves whole nodes for jobs,
not partial nodes. If during backfill scheduling a job preempts one or more
other jobs, the whole nodes for those preempted jobs are reserved for the
preemptor job, even if the preemptor job requested fewer resources than that.
These reserved nodes aren't available to other jobs during that backfill
cycle, even if the other jobs could fit on the nodes. Therefore, jobs may
preempt more resources during a single backfill iteration than they requested.
NOTE :
For heterogeneous job to be considered for preemption all components
must be eligible for preemption. When a heterogeneous job is to be preempted
the first identified component of the job with the highest order PreemptMode
( SUSPEND (highest), REQUEUE , CANCEL (lowest)) will be
used to set the PreemptMode for all components. The GraceTime and user
warning signal for each component of the heterogeneous job remain unique.
Heterogeneous jobs are excluded from GANG scheduling operations.
OFF [#OPT_OFF](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Is the default value and disables job preemption and gang scheduling.
It is only compatible with preemption being disabled at the global level.
A common use case for this parameter is to set it on a partition to disable
preemption for that partition.
CANCEL [#OPT_CANCEL](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The preempted job will be cancelled.
GANG [#OPT_GANG](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Enables gang scheduling (time slicing) of jobs in the same partition, and
allows the resuming of suspended jobs. In order to use gang scheduling, the
GANG option must be specified at the cluster level.
NOTE:
If GANG scheduling is enabled with
PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio , the controller will ignore
PreemptExemptTime and the following PreemptParameters :
reorder_count , strict_order , and youngest_first .
NOTE :
Gang scheduling is performed independently for each partition, so
if you only want time-slicing by OverSubscribe , without any preemption,
then configuring partitions with overlapping nodes is not recommended.
On the other hand, if you want to use PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio
to allow jobs from higher PriorityTier partitions to Suspend jobs from lower
PriorityTier partitions you will need overlapping partitions, and
PreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG to use the Gang scheduler to resume the suspended
jobs(s). You must configure the partition's OverSubscribe setting to
FORCE for all partitions in which time-slicing is to take place.
In any case, time-slicing won't happen between jobs on different partitions.
NOTE :
Heterogeneous jobs are excluded from GANG scheduling operations.
NOTE :
In case of overlapping partitions. If the node is allocated job that allows
sharing of resources (Oversubscribe=FORCE or Oversubscribe=YES and job was
submitted with -s / --oversubscribe ) it can only be allocated by
jobs from the same partition.
REQUEUE [#OPT_REQUEUE](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Preempts jobs by requeuing them (if possible) or canceling them.
For jobs to be requeued they must have the --requeue sbatch option set
or the cluster wide JobRequeue parameter in slurm.conf must be set to 1 .
SUSPEND [#OPT_SUSPEND](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The preempted jobs will be suspended, and later the Gang scheduler will resume
them. Therefore the SUSPEND preemption mode always needs the GANG
option to be specified at the cluster level. Also, because the suspended jobs
will still use memory on the allocated nodes, Slurm needs to be able to track
memory resources to be able to suspend jobs.
When suspending jobs, Slurm sends the SIGTSTP signal, waits the time specified
by PreemptParameters=suspend_grace_time (default is 2 seconds), then
sends the SIGSTOP signal. The SIGCONT signal is sent when resuming jobs.
If PreemptType=preempt/qos is configured and if the preempted job(s) and
the preemptor job are on the same partition, then they will share resources with
the Gang scheduler (time-slicing). If not (i.e. if the preemptees and preemptor
are on different partitions) then the preempted jobs will remain suspended until
the preemptor ends.
NOTE : Because gang scheduling is performed independently for each
partition, if using PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio then jobs in
higher PriorityTier partitions will suspend jobs in lower PriorityTier
partitions to run on the released resources. Only when the preemptor job ends
will the suspended jobs will be resumed by the Gang scheduler.
NOTE : Suspended jobs will not release GRES. Higher priority jobs will not
be able to preempt to gain access to GRES.
PRIORITY [#OPT_PRIORITY](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Allow preemption only if the preemptor's job priority is higher than the
preemptee's job priority.
WITHIN [#OPT_WITHIN](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) For PreemptType=preempt/qos , allow jobs within the same qos to preempt
one another. While this can be set globally here, it is recommend that this
only be set directly on a relevant subset of the system qos values instead.
PreemptParameters [#OPT_PreemptParameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Multiple options may be comma separated.
min_exempt_priority =#[#OPT_min_exempt_priority](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Threshold value for the job's global priority. Only those jobs with priority
lower than this value will be marked as preemptable.
reclaim_licenses [#OPT_reclaim_licenses](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, jobs may be preempted to reclaim licenses. Otherwise jobs requesting
busy licenses will have to wait even if they have preemption priority.
The logic to support this option is only available in the select/cons_tres
plugin. Jobs that use OR in the license request are not eligible to preempt
other jobs to reclaim licenses.
reorder_count =#[#OPT_reorder_count](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specify how many attempts should be made in reordering preemptable jobs to
minimize the total number of jobs that will be preempted.
The default value is 1. High values may adversely impact performance.
Changes to the order of jobs on these attempts can be enabled with
strict_order .
The logic to support this option is only available in the select/cons_tres
plugin.
send_user_signal [#OPT_send_user_signal](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Send the user signal (e.g. --signal=<sig_num>) at preemption time even if the
signal time hasn't been reached. In the case of a gracetime preemption the user
signal will be sent if the user signal has been specified and not sent,
otherwise a SIGTERM will be sent to the tasks.
strict_order [#OPT_strict_order](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) When reordering preemptable jobs, place the most recently tested job at the
front of the list since we are certain that it actually added resources needed
by the new job. This ensures that with enough reorder attempts, the minimum
possible number of jobs will be preempted.
See also reorder_count .
The logic to support this option is only available in the select/cons_tres
plugin.
suspend_grace_time [#OPT_suspend_grace_time](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specifies, in units of seconds, the preemption grace time when using
PreemptMode=SUSPEND .
When a job is suspended, the SIGTSTP signal will be sent, and then after waiting
the specified suspend grace time, the SIGSTOP signal will be sent.
The default value is 2 seconds.
NOTE : This parameter is only used when PreemptMode=SUSPEND is
configured or when suspending jobs with scontrol suspend.
For setting the preemption grace time when using other preemption modes,
see GraceTime .
youngest_first [#OPT_youngest_first](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, then the preemption sorting algorithm will be changed to sort by the
job start times to favor preempting younger jobs over older. (Requires
preempt/partition_prio or preempt/qos plugins.)
PreemptType [#OPT_PreemptType](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specifies the plugin used to identify which jobs can be
preempted in order to start a pending job. Unset by default.
preempt/partition_prio [#OPT_preempt/partition_prio](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Job preemption is based upon partition PriorityTier .
Jobs in higher PriorityTier partitions may preempt jobs from lower
PriorityTier partitions.
This is not compatible with PreemptMode=OFF .
preempt/qos [#OPT_preempt/qos](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Job preemption rules are specified by Quality Of Service (QOS) specifications
in the Slurm database.
In the case of PreemptMode=SUSPEND , a preempting job has to be submitted
to a partition with a higher PriorityTier or to the same partition. Submission
to the same partition is also supported, which results in the preemptor QoS to
gang schedule the preemptee QoS.
This option is not compatible with PreemptMode=OFF .
A configuration of PreemptMode=SUSPEND is only supported by the
SelectType=select/cons_tres plugin.
See the sacctmgr man page to configure the options for preempt/qos .
PreemptExemptTime [#OPT_PreemptExemptTime](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Global option for minimum run time for all jobs before they can be considered
for preemption. Any QOS PreemptExemptTime takes precedence over the global
option. This is only honored for PreemptMode=REQUEUE and
PreemptMode=CANCEL .
A time of -1 disables the option, equivalent to 0. Acceptable time formats
include "minutes", "minutes:seconds", "hours:minutes:seconds", "days-hours",
"days-hours:minutes", and "days-hours:minutes:seconds".
PrEpParameters [#OPT_PrEpParameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Parameters to be passed to the PrEpPlugins .
PrEpPlugins [#OPT_PrEpPlugins](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) A resource for programmers wishing to write their own plugins for the Prolog and
Epilog (PrEp) scripts. The default, and currently the only implemented plugin is
prep/script . Additional plugins can be specified in a comma-separated
list. For more information please see the PrEp Plugin API documentation page:
<[https://slurm.schedmd.com/prep_plugins.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/prep_plugins.html)>
PriorityCalcPeriod [#OPT_PriorityCalcPeriod](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The period of time in minutes in which the half-life decay will be
re-calculated.
Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.
The default value is 5 (minutes).
PriorityDecayHalfLife [#OPT_PriorityDecayHalfLife](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) This controls how long prior resource use is considered in determining
how over- or under-serviced an association is (user, account and
cluster) in determining job priority.
The record of usage will be decayed over time, with half of the original value
cleared at age PriorityDecayHalfLife .
If set to 0 no decay will be applied.
This is helpful if you want to enforce hard time limits per association. If
set to 0 PriorityUsageResetPeriod must be set to some interval.
Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.
The unit is a time string (i.e. min, hr:min:00, days-hr:min:00,
or days-hr). The default value is 7-0 (7 days).
PriorityFavorSmall [#OPT_PriorityFavorSmall](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specifies that small jobs should be given preferential scheduling priority.
Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.
Supported values are "YES" and "NO". The default value is "NO".
PriorityFlags [#OPT_PriorityFlags](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Flags to modify priority behavior.
Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.
The keywords below have no associated value
(e.g. "PriorityFlags=ACCRUE_ALWAYS,SMALL_RELATIVE_TO_TIME").
ACCRUE_ALWAYS [#OPT_ACCRUE_ALWAYS](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, priority age factor will be increased despite job ineligibility due to
either dependencies, holds or begin time in the future. Accrue limits are
ignored.
CALCULATE_RUNNING [#OPT_CALCULATE_RUNNING](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, priorities will be recalculated not only for pending jobs, but also
running and suspended jobs.
DEPTH_OBLIVIOUS [#OPT_DEPTH_OBLIVIOUS](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, priority will be calculated based similar to the normal multifactor
calculation, but depth of the associations in the tree does not adversely
affect their priority. This option automatically enables NO_FAIR_TREE.
NO_FAIR_TREE [#OPT_NO_FAIR_TREE](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Disables the "fair tree" algorithm, and reverts to "classic" fair share
priority scheduling.
INCR_ONLY [#OPT_INCR_ONLY](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, priority values will only increase in value. Job priority will never
decrease in value.
MAX_TRES [#OPT_MAX_TRES](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, the weighted TRES value ( TRESBillingWeights ) is calculated as the
sum of the following:
- MAX of individual TRESs (those tied to a specific node, e.g., cpus, mem, gres)
- SUM of all global TRESs (those available on any nodes, e.g., licenses)
Refer to the TRES page for more details: <[https://slurm.schedmd.com/tres.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/tres.html)>
MAX_TRES_GRES [#OPT_MAX_TRES_GRES](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, the weighted TRES value ( TRESBillingWeights ) is calculated as the
sum of the following:
- SUM of all billable GRESs (e.g., GPUs)
- MAX of other individual TRESs (those tied to a specific node, e.g., cpus, mem)
- SUM of all global TRESs (those available on any nodes, e.g., licenses)
Added in Slurm 25.05. Refer to the TRES page for more details:
<[https://slurm.schedmd.com/tres.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/tres.html)>
NO_NORMAL_ALL [#OPT_NO_NORMAL_ALL](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, all NO_NORMAL_* flags are set.
NO_NORMAL_ASSOC [#OPT_NO_NORMAL_ASSOC](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, the association factor is not normalized against the highest association
priority.
NO_NORMAL_PART [#OPT_NO_NORMAL_PART](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, the partition factor is not normalized against the highest partition
PriorityJobFactor .
NO_NORMAL_QOS [#OPT_NO_NORMAL_QOS](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, the QOS factor is not normalized against the highest qos priority.
NO_NORMAL_TRES [#OPT_NO_NORMAL_TRES](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, the TRES factor is not normalized against the job's partition TRES
counts.
SMALL_RELATIVE_TO_TIME [#OPT_SMALL_RELATIVE_TO_TIME](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, the job's size component will be based upon not the job size alone, but
the job's size divided by its time limit.
PriorityMaxAge [#OPT_PriorityMaxAge](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specifies the job age which will be given the maximum age factor in computing
priority. For example, a value of 30 minutes would result in all jobs over
30 minutes old would get the same age-based priority.
Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.
The unit is a time string (i.e. min, hr:min:00, days-hr:min:00,
or days-hr). The default value is 7-0 (7 days).
PriorityParameters [#OPT_PriorityParameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Arbitrary string used by the PriorityType plugin.
PrioritySiteFactorParameters [#OPT_PrioritySiteFactorParameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Arbitrary string used by the PrioritySiteFactorPlugin plugin.
PrioritySiteFactorPlugin [#OPT_PrioritySiteFactorPlugin](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The specifies an optional plugin to be used alongside "priority/multifactor",
which is meant to initially set and continuously update the SiteFactor
priority factor. Unset by default.
PriorityType [#OPT_PriorityType](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) This specifies the plugin to be used in establishing a job's scheduling
priority.
Also see PriorityFlags for configuration options.
The default value is "priority/multifactor".
priority/basic [#OPT_priority/basic](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Jobs are evaluated in a First In, First Out (FIFO) manner.
priority/multifactor [#OPT_priority/multifactor](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Jobs are assigned a priority based upon a variety of factors
that include size, age, Fairshare, etc.
When not FIFO scheduling, jobs are prioritized in the following order:
1. Jobs that can preempt
2. Jobs with an advanced reservation
3. Partition PriorityTier
4. Job priority
5. Job submit time
6. Job ID
PriorityUsageResetPeriod [#OPT_PriorityUsageResetPeriod](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) At this interval the usage of associations will be reset to 0. This is used
if you want to enforce hard limits of time usage per association. If
PriorityDecayHalfLife is set to be 0 no decay will happen and this is the
only way to reset the usage accumulated by running jobs. By default this is
turned off and it is advised to use the PriorityDecayHalfLife option to avoid
not having anything running on your cluster, but if your schema is set up to
only allow certain amounts of time on your system this is the way to do it.
Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.
NONE [#OPT_NONE](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Never clear historic usage. The default value.
NOW [#OPT_NOW](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Clear the historic usage now.

Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.
Requires AccountingStorageType=accounting_storage/slurmdbd.
The default value is 0.
PriorityWeightAssoc [#OPT_PriorityWeightAssoc](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) An integer value that sets the degree to which the association

Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.
The default value is 0.
PriorityWeightFairshare [#OPT_PriorityWeightFairshare](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) An integer value that sets the degree to which the fair-share
component contributes to the job's priority.
Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.
Requires AccountingStorageType=accounting_storage/slurmdbd.

PriorityWeightJobSize [#OPT_PriorityWeightJobSize](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) An integer value that sets the degree to which the job size
component contributes to the job's priority.
Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.
The default value is 0.
PriorityWeightPartition [#OPT_PriorityWeightPartition](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Partition factor used by priority/multifactor plugin in calculating job priority.
Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.
The default value is 0.
PriorityWeightQOS [#OPT_PriorityWeightQOS](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) An integer value that sets the degree to which the Quality Of Service
component contributes to the job's priority.
Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.
The default value is 0.

TRES Type contributes to the job's priority.
```text
e.g. PriorityWeightTRES=CPU=1000,Mem=2000,GRES/gpu=3000
```
Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor and if
AccountingStorageTRES is configured with each TRES Type.
Negative values are allowed.
The default values are 0.
PrivateData [#OPT_PrivateData](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) This controls what type of information is hidden from regular users.
By default, all information is visible to all users.
User SlurmUser and root can always view all information.
Multiple values may be specified with a comma separator.
Acceptable values include:
accounts [#OPT_accounts](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) (NON-SlurmDBD ACCOUNTING ONLY) Prevents users from viewing any account
definitions unless they are coordinators of them.
events [#OPT_events](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) prevents users from viewing event information unless they have operator status
or above.
jobs [#OPT_jobs](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Prevents users from viewing jobs or job steps belonging
to other users. (NON-SlurmDBD ACCOUNTING ONLY) Prevents users from viewing
job records belonging to other users unless they are coordinators of
the association running the job when using sacct.
nodes [#OPT_nodes](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Prevents users from viewing node state information.
partitions [#OPT_partitions](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Prevents users from viewing partition state information.
reservations [#OPT_reservations](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Prevents regular users from viewing reservations which they can not use.
usage [#OPT_usage](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Prevents users from viewing usage of any other user, this applies to 'sshare'
and Association Records through 'scontrol show assoc_mgr'.
(NON-SlurmDBD ACCOUNTING ONLY) Prevents users from viewing
usage of any other user, this applies to sreport.
users [#OPT_users](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) (NON-SlurmDBD ACCOUNTING ONLY) Prevents users from viewing
information of any user other than themselves, this also makes it so users can
only see associations they deal with.
Coordinators can see associations of all users in the account they are
coordinator of, but can only see themselves when listing users.
ProctrackType [#OPT_ProctrackType](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Identifies the plugin to be used for process tracking on a job step basis.
The slurmd daemon uses this mechanism to identify all processes
which are children of processes it spawns for a user job step.
NOTE : "proctrack/linuxproc" and "proctrack/pgid" can fail to
identify all processes associated with a job since processes
can become a child of the init process (when the parent process
terminates) or change their process group.
To reliably track all processes, "proctrack/cgroup" is highly recommended.
NOTE : The NamespaceType applies to a job namespace isolation,
while ProctrackType applies to job resource limits and tracking.
Acceptable values at present include:
proctrack/cgroup [#OPT_proctrack/cgroup](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Uses linux cgroups to constrain and track processes, and is the default
for systems with cgroup support.
NOTE : See "man cgroup.conf" for configuration details.
proctrack/linuxproc [#OPT_proctrack/linuxproc](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Uses linux process tree using parent process IDs.
proctrack/pgid [#OPT_proctrack/pgid](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Uses Process Group IDs.
NOTE : This is the default for the BSD family.
Prolog [#OPT_Prolog](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Pathname of a program for the slurmd to execute whenever it is asked to run a
job step from a new job allocation. If it is not an absolute path name (i.e. it
does not start with a slash), it will be searched for in the same directory as
the slurm.conf file. A glob pattern (See glob (7)) may also be used to
specify more than one program to run (e.g. "/etc/slurm/prolog.d/*"). When more
than one prolog script is configured, they are executed in reverse alphabetical
order (z-a -> Z-A -> 9-0). The slurmd executes the prolog before starting
the first job step. The prolog script or scripts may be used to purge files,
enable user login, etc. By default there is no prolog. Any configured script
is expected to complete execution quickly (in less time than
MessageTimeout ).
If the prolog fails (returns a non-zero exit code), this will result in the
node being set to a DRAIN state and the job being requeued. The job will be
placed in a held state, unless nohold_on_prolog_fail is configured in
SchedulerParameters .
See Prolog and Epilog Scripts for more information.
NOTE : It is possible to configure multiple prolog scripts by including
this option on multiple lines.
PrologEpilogTimeout [#OPT_PrologEpilogTimeout](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The interval in seconds Slurm waits for Prolog and Epilog before terminating
them. The default behavior is to wait indefinitely. This interval applies to
the Prolog and Epilog run by slurmd daemon before and after the job, the
PrologSlurmctld and EpilogSlurmctld run by slurmctld daemon, and the SPANK
plugin prolog/epilog calls: slurm_spank_job_prolog and slurm_spank_job_epilog.
If the PrologSlurmctld times out, the job is requeued if possible.
If the Prolog or slurm_spank_job_prolog time out, the job is requeued if
possible and the node is drained.
If the Epilog or slurm_spank_job_epilog time out, the node is drained.
In all cases, errors are logged.
NOTE : This value is not used for prologs if PrologTimeout is configured.
Likewise, this value is not used for epilogs if EpilogTimout is configured.
PrologTimeout [#OPT_PrologTimeout](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The interval in seconds Slurm waits for Prolog before terminating them. The
default value is PrologEpilogTimeout . This interval applies to the Prolog
run by slurmd daemon before the job, the PrologSlurmctld run by slurmctld
daemon, and the SPANK plugin prolog call: slurm_spank_job_prolog.
If the PrologSlurmctld times out, the job is requeued if possible.
If the Prolog or slurm_spank_job_prolog time out, the job is requeued if
possible and the node is drained. In all cases, errors are logged.
PrologFlags [#OPT_PrologFlags](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Flags to control the Prolog behavior. By default no flags are set.
Multiple flags may be specified in a comma-separated list.
Currently supported options are:
Alloc [#OPT_Alloc](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, the Prolog script will be executed at job allocation. By default,
Prolog is executed just before the task is launched. Therefore, when salloc
is started, no Prolog is executed. Alloc is useful for preparing things
before a user starts to use any allocated resources.
In particular, this flag is needed on a Cray system when cluster compatibility
mode is enabled.
NOTE : Use of the Alloc flag will increase the time required to start jobs.
Contain [#OPT_Contain](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) At job allocation time, use the ProcTrack plugin to create a job container
on all allocated compute nodes.
This container may be used for user processes not launched under Slurm control,
for example pam_slurm_adopt may place processes launched through a direct user
login into this container. If using pam_slurm_adopt, then ProcTrackType must be
set to proctrack/cgroup .
Setting the Contain implicitly sets the Alloc flag.
DeferBatch [#OPT_DeferBatch](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, slurmctld will wait until the prolog completes on all allocated
nodes before sending the batch job launch request. With just the Alloc flag,
slurmctld will launch the batch step as soon as the first node in the job
allocation completes the prolog.
NoHold [#OPT_NoHold](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, the Alloc flag should also be set. This will allow for salloc to not
block until the prolog is finished on each node. The blocking will happen when
steps reach the slurmd and before any execution has happened in the step.
This is a much faster way to work and if using srun to launch your tasks you
should use this flag. This flag cannot be combined with the Contain or X11
flags.
ForceRequeueOnFail [#OPT_ForceRequeueOnFail](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) When a batch job fails to launch due to a Prolog failure, always requeue it
automatically even if the job requested no requeues.
NOTE : Setting this flag implicitly sets the Alloc flag.
RunInJob [#OPT_RunInJob](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Make the Prolog/Epilog run in the extern slurmstepd. This will contain it in one
of on the job's processes. This will contain it in the cgroup if configured.
Setting the RunInJob flag implicitly sets the Contain and Alloc flag.
Serial [#OPT_Serial](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) By default, the Prolog and Epilog scripts run concurrently on each node.
This flag forces those scripts to run serially within each node, but with
a significant penalty to job throughput on each node.
NOTE : This is incompatible with RunInJob.
X11 [#OPT_X11](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Enable Slurm's built-in X11 forwarding capabilities.
This is incompatible with ProctrackType=proctrack/linuxproc .
Setting the X11 flag implicitly enables both Contain and Alloc flags as well.
PrologSlurmctld [#OPT_PrologSlurmctld](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Fully qualified pathname of a program for the slurmctld daemon to execute
before granting a new job allocation (e.g.
"/usr/local/slurm/prolog_controller").
The program executes as SlurmUser on the same node where the slurmctld daemon
executes, giving it permission to drain
nodes and requeue the job if a failure occurs or cancel the job if appropriate.
Exactly what the program does and how it accomplishes this is completely at
the discretion of the system administrator.
Information about the job being initiated, its allocated nodes, etc. are
passed to the program using environment variables.
While this program is running, the nodes associated with the job will be
have a POWER_UP/CONFIGURING flag set in their state, which can be readily
viewed.
The slurmctld daemon will wait indefinitely for this program to complete.
Once the program completes with an exit code of zero, the nodes will be
considered ready for use and the program will be started.
If some node can not be made available for use, the program should drain
the node (typically using the scontrol command) and terminate with a non-zero
exit code.
A non-zero exit code will result in the job being requeued (where possible)
or killed. Note that only batch jobs can be requeued.
See Prolog and Epilog Scripts for more information.
NOTE : It is possible to configure multiple prolog scripts by including
this option on multiple lines.
PropagatePrioProcess [#OPT_PropagatePrioProcess](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Controls the scheduling priority (nice value) of user spawned tasks.
0 [#OPT_0](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The tasks will inherit the scheduling priority from the slurm daemon.
This is the default value.
1 [#OPT_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The tasks will inherit the scheduling priority of the command used to
submit them (e.g. srun or sbatch ).
Unless the job is submitted by user root, the tasks will have a scheduling
priority no higher than the slurm daemon spawning them.
2 [#OPT_2](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The tasks will inherit the scheduling priority of the command used to
submit them (e.g. srun or sbatch ) with the restriction that
their nice value will always be one higher than the slurm daemon (i.e.
the tasks scheduling priority will be lower than the slurm daemon).
PropagateResourceLimits [#OPT_PropagateResourceLimits](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) A comma-separated list of resource limit names.
The slurmd daemon uses these names to obtain the associated (soft) limit
values from the user's process environment on the submit node.
These limits are then propagated and applied to the jobs that
will run on the compute nodes.
This parameter can be useful when system limits vary among nodes.
Any resource limits that do not appear in the list are not propagated.
However, the user can override this by specifying which resource limits
to propagate with the sbatch or srun "--propagate" option. If neither
PropagateResourceLimits or PropagateResourceLimitsExcept are
configured and the "--propagate" option is not specified, then the default
action is to propagate all limits. Only one of the parameters, either
PropagateResourceLimits or PropagateResourceLimitsExcept, may be specified.
The user limits can not exceed hard limits under which the slurmd daemon
operates. If the user limits are not propagated, the limits from the slurmd
daemon will be propagated to the user's job. The limits used for the Slurm
daemons can be set in the /etc/sysconf/slurm file. For more information, see:
[https://slurm.schedmd.com/faq.html#memlock](https://slurm.schedmd.com/faq.html)
The following limit names are supported by Slurm (although some
options may not be supported on some systems):
ALL [#OPT_ALL_2](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) All limits listed below (default)
NONE [#OPT_NONE_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) No limits listed below
AS [#OPT_AS](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum address space (virtual memory) for a process.
CORE [#OPT_CORE](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum size of core file
CPU [#OPT_CPU](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum amount of CPU time
DATA [#OPT_DATA](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum size of a process's data segment
FSIZE [#OPT_FSIZE](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum size of files created. Note that if the user sets FSIZE to less
than the current size of the slurmd.log, job launches will fail with
a 'File size limit exceeded' error.
MEMLOCK [#OPT_MEMLOCK](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum size that may be locked into memory
NOFILE [#OPT_NOFILE](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum number of open files
NPROC [#OPT_NPROC](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum number of processes available
RSS [#OPT_RSS](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum resident set size. Note that this only has effect with Linux
kernels 2.4.30 or older or BSD.
STACK [#OPT_STACK](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum stack size
PropagateResourceLimitsExcept [#OPT_PropagateResourceLimitsExcept](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) A comma-separated list of resource limit names.
By default, all resource limits will be propagated, (as described by
the PropagateResourceLimits parameter), except for the limits
appearing in this list. The user can override this by specifying which
resource limits to propagate with the sbatch or srun "--propagate" option.
See PropagateResourceLimits above for a list of valid limit names.
RebootProgram [#OPT_RebootProgram](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Program to be executed on each compute node to reboot it. Invoked on each node
once it becomes idle after the command "scontrol reboot" is executed by
an authorized user or a job is submitted with the "--reboot" option.
After rebooting, the node is returned to normal use.
See ResumeTimeout to configure the time you expect a reboot to finish in.
A node will be marked DOWN if it doesn't reboot within ResumeTimeout .
ReconfigFlags [#OPT_ReconfigFlags](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Flags to control various actions that may be taken when an "scontrol
reconfig" command is issued. Currently the options are:
KeepPartInfo [#OPT_KeepPartInfo](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, an "scontrol reconfig" command will maintain the in-memory
value of partition "state" and other parameters that may have been
dynamically updated by "scontrol update". Partition information in
the slurm.conf file will be merged with in-memory data. This flag
supersedes the KeepPartState flag.
KeepPartState [#OPT_KeepPartState](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, an "scontrol reconfig" command will preserve only the current
"state" value of in-memory partitions and will reset all other
parameters of the partitions that may have been dynamically updated by
"scontrol update" to the values from the slurm.conf file. Partition
information in the slurm.conf file will be merged with in-memory
data.
KeepPowerSaveSettings [#OPT_KeepPowerSaveSettings](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, an "scontrol reconfig" command will preserve the current state of
SuspendExcNodes, SuspendExcParts and SuspendExcStates.
The default for the above flags is not set, and the
"scontrol reconfig" will rebuild the partition information using only
the definitions in the slurm.conf file.
RequeueExit [#OPT_RequeueExit](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Enables automatic requeue for batch jobs which exit with the specified
values.
Separate multiple exit code by a comma and/or specify numeric ranges using a
"-" separator (e.g. "RequeueExit=1-9,18")
Jobs will be put back in to pending state and later scheduled again.
Restarted jobs will have the environment variable SLURM_RESTART_COUNT
set to the number of times the job has been restarted.
RequeueExitHold [#OPT_RequeueExitHold](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Enables automatic requeue for batch jobs which exit with the specified
values, with these jobs being held until released manually by the user.
Separate multiple exit code by a comma and/or specify numeric ranges using a
"-" separator (e.g. "RequeueExitHold=10-12,16")
These jobs are put in the JOB_SPECIAL_EXIT exit state.
Restarted jobs will have the environment variable SLURM_RESTART_COUNT
set to the number of times the job has been restarted.
ResumeFailProgram [#OPT_ResumeFailProgram](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The program that will be executed when nodes fail to resume to by
ResumeTimeout . The argument to the program will be the names of the failed
nodes (using Slurm's hostlist expression format).
Programs will be killed if they run longer than the largest configured, global
or partition, ResumeTimeout or SuspendTimeout .
ResumeProgram [#OPT_ResumeProgram](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Slurm supports a mechanism to reduce power consumption on nodes that
remain idle for an extended period of time.
This is typically accomplished by reducing voltage and frequency or powering
the node down.
ResumeProgram is the program that will be executed when a node
in power save mode is assigned work to perform.
For reasons of reliability, ResumeProgram may execute more than once
for a node when the slurmctld daemon crashes and is restarted.
If ResumeProgram is unable to restore a node to service with a responding
slurmd and an updated BootTime, it should set the node state to DOWN, which will
result in a requeue of any job associated with the node - this will happen
automatically if the node doesn't register within ResumeTimeout.
SchedulerParameters=requeue_on_resume_failure can be used to always
requeue batch jobs in this situation, even if the job requested no requeues.
If the node isn't actually rebooted (i.e. when multiple-slurmd is configured)
starting slurmd with "-b" option might be useful.
The program executes as SlurmUser .
The argument to the program will be the names of nodes to
be removed from power savings mode (using Slurm's hostlist
expression format). A job to node mapping is available in JSON format by
reading the temporary file specified by the SLURM_RESUME_FILE environment
variable.
This file is closed once slurmctld shuts down. If ResumeProgram is running,
slurmctld shutdown is delayed by up to ten seconds to give ResumeProgram time
to read this file. Therefore, this file should be read at the beginning of
ResumeProgram.
By default no program is run.
Programs will be killed if they run longer than the largest configured, global
or partition, ResumeTimeout or SuspendTimeout .
ResumeRate [#OPT_ResumeRate](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The rate at which nodes in power save mode are returned to normal
operation by ResumeProgram .
The value is a number of nodes per minute and it can be used to prevent
power surges if a large number of nodes in power save mode are
assigned work at the same time (e.g. a large job starts).
A value of zero results in no limits being imposed.
The default value is 300 nodes per minute.
ResumeTimeout [#OPT_ResumeTimeout](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Maximum time permitted (in seconds) between when a node resume request
is issued and when the node is actually available for use.
Nodes which fail to respond in this time frame will be marked DOWN and
the jobs scheduled on the node requeued if possible.
Nodes which reboot after this time frame will be marked DOWN with a reason of
"Node unexpectedly rebooted."
The default value is 60 seconds, and the maximum value is either 65533 or
INFINITE.
ResvEpilog [#OPT_ResvEpilog](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Fully qualified pathname of a program for the slurmctld to execute
when a reservation ends. It does not run when a running reservation is
deleted. The program can be used to cancel jobs, modify
partition configuration, etc.
The reservation named will be passed as an argument to the program.
By default there is no epilog.
ResvOverRun [#OPT_ResvOverRun](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Describes how long a job already running in a reservation should be
permitted to execute after the end time of the reservation has been
reached.
The time period is specified in minutes and the default value is 0
(kill the job immediately).
The value may not exceed 65533 minutes, although a value of "UNLIMITED"
is supported to permit a job to run indefinitely after its reservation
is terminated.
ResvProlog [#OPT_ResvProlog](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Fully qualified pathname of a program for the slurmctld to execute
when a reservation begins. The program can be used to cancel jobs, modify
partition configuration, etc.
The reservation named will be passed as an argument to the program.
By default there is no prolog.
ReturnToService [#OPT_ReturnToService](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Controls when a DOWN node will be returned to service.
The default value is 0.
Supported values include
0 [#OPT_0_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) A node will remain in the DOWN state until a system administrator
explicitly changes its state (even if the slurmd daemon registers
and resumes communications).
1 [#OPT_1_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) A DOWN node will become available for use upon registration with a
valid configuration only if it was set DOWN due to being non-responsive.
If the node was set DOWN for any other reason (low memory,
unexpected reboot, etc.), its state will not automatically
be changed.
A node registers with a valid configuration if its memory, GRES, CPU count,
etc. are equal to or greater than the values configured in slurm.conf.
2 [#OPT_2_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) A DOWN node will become available for use upon registration with a
valid configuration. The node could have been set DOWN for any reason.
A node registers with a valid configuration if its memory, GRES, CPU count,
etc. are equal to or greater than the values configured in slurm.conf.
SchedulerParameters [#OPT_SchedulerParameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The interpretation of this parameter varies by SchedulerType .
Multiple options may be comma separated.
allow_zero_lic [#OPT_allow_zero_lic](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, then job submissions requesting more than configured licenses won't be
rejected.
assoc_limit_stop [#OPT_assoc_limit_stop](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set and a job cannot start due to association limits, then do not attempt
to initiate any lower priority jobs in that partition. Setting this can
decrease system throughput and utilization, but avoid potentially starving larger
jobs by preventing them from launching indefinitely.
batch_sched_delay =#[#OPT_batch_sched_delay](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) How long, in seconds, the scheduling of batch jobs can be delayed.
This can be useful in a high-throughput environment in which batch jobs are
submitted at a very high rate (i.e. using the sbatch command) and one wishes
to reduce the overhead of attempting to schedule each job at submit time.
The default value is 3 seconds.
bb_array_stage_cnt =#[#OPT_bb_array_stage_cnt](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Number of tasks from a job array that should be available for burst buffer
resource allocation. Higher values will increase the system overhead as each
task from the job array will be moved to its own job record in memory, so
relatively small values are generally recommended.
The default value is 10.
bf_allow_magnetic_slot [#OPT_bf_allow_magnetic_slot](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) By default the backfill scheduler will not add a slot in the bf plan when a job
attempts to use a magnetic reservation. This option reverses this to make the
backfill scheduler add slots in the bf plan when jobs are eligible to run in a
magnetic reservation. With this option enabled, jobs inside magnetic
reservations will respect priorities and also be counted against the backfill
limits such as bf_max_job_test .
NOTE :
Backfill first evaluates jobs inside reservations, which means all
magnetic jobs will be tested first. When enabling this option, make sure to
revise (increasing if necessary) the backfill limits configured to validate
backfill cycle gets to test the expected jobs in the queue.
NOTE :
If bf_one_resv_per_job is used along with this option the magnetic
reservation slot will now be the only slot in the bf plan. Otherwise the
slot will be the first one outside the magnetic reservation.
bf_busy_nodes [#OPT_bf_busy_nodes](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) When selecting resources for pending jobs to reserve for future execution
(i.e. the job can not be started immediately), then preferentially select
nodes that are in use.
This will tend to leave currently idle resources available for backfilling
longer running jobs, but may result in allocations having less than optimal
network topology.
This option is currently only supported by the select/cons_tres plugin.
bf_continue [#OPT_bf_continue](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The backfill scheduler periodically releases locks in order to permit other
operations to proceed rather than blocking all activity for what could be an
extended period of time.
Setting this option will cause the backfill scheduler to continue processing
pending jobs from its original job list after releasing locks even if job
or node state changes.
bf_hetjob_immediate [#OPT_bf_hetjob_immediate](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Instruct the backfill scheduler to attempt to start a heterogeneous job as
soon as all of its components are determined able to do so. Otherwise, the
backfill scheduler will delay heterogeneous jobs initiation attempts until
after the rest of the queue has been processed. This delay may result in lower
priority jobs being allocated resources, which could delay the initiation of
the heterogeneous job due to account and/or QOS limits being reached. This
option is disabled by default. If enabled and bf_hetjob_prio=min is not
set, then it would be automatically set.
bf_hetjob_prio=[min|avg|max] [#OPT_bf_hetjob_prio=[min|avg|max]](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) At the beginning of each backfill scheduling cycle, a list of pending to be
scheduled jobs is sorted according to the precedence order configured in
PriorityType . This option instructs the scheduler to alter the sorting
algorithm to ensure that all components belonging to the same heterogeneous job
will be attempted to be scheduled consecutively (thus not fragmented in the
resulting list). More specifically, all components from the same heterogeneous
job will be treated as if they all have the same priority (minimum, average or
maximum depending upon this option's parameter) when compared with other jobs
(or other heterogeneous job components). The original order will be preserved
within the same heterogeneous job. Note that the operation is calculated for
the PriorityTier layer and for the Priority resulting from the
priority/multifactor plugin calculations. When enabled, if any heterogeneous job
requested an advanced reservation, then all of that job's components will be
treated as if they had requested an advanced reservation (and get
preferential treatment in scheduling).
Note that this operation does not update the Priority values of the
heterogeneous job components, only their order within the list, so the output of
the sprio command will not be affected.
Heterogeneous jobs have special scheduling properties: they are only scheduled
by the backfill scheduling plugin, each of their components is considered
separately when reserving resources (and might have different PriorityTier
or different Priority values), and no heterogeneous job component is
actually allocated resources until all if its components can be initiated.
This may imply potential scheduling deadlock scenarios because components
from different heterogeneous jobs can start reserving resources in an
interleaved fashion (not consecutively), but none of the jobs can reserve
resources for all components and start. Enabling this option can help to
mitigate this problem. By default, this option is disabled.
bf_interval =#[#OPT_bf_interval](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The number of seconds between backfill iterations.
Higher values result in less overhead and better responsiveness.
This option applies only to SchedulerType=sched/backfill .
Default: 30, Min: 1, Max: 10800 (3h).
A setting of -1 will disable the backfill scheduling loop.
bf_job_part_count_reserve =#[#OPT_bf_job_part_count_reserve](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The backfill scheduling logic will reserve resources for the specified count
of highest priority jobs in each partition.
For example, bf_job_part_count_reserve=10 will cause the backfill scheduler to
reserve resources for the ten highest priority jobs in each partition.
Any lower priority job that can be started using currently available resources
and not adversely impact the expected start time of these higher priority jobs
will be started by the backfill scheduler
The default value is zero, which will reserve resources for any pending job
and delay initiation of lower priority jobs.
Also see bf_min_age_reserve and bf_min_prio_reserve.
Default: 0, Min: 0, Max: 100000.
bf_licenses [#OPT_bf_licenses](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Require the backfill scheduling logic to track and plan for license
availability. By default, any job blocked on license availability will not
have resources reserved which can lead to job starvation.
This option implicitly enables bf_running_job_reserve .
bf_max_job_array_resv =#[#OPT_bf_max_job_array_resv](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum number of tasks from a job array for which the backfill scheduler
will reserve resources in the future.
Since job arrays can potentially have millions of tasks, the overhead in
reserving resources for all tasks can be prohibitive.
In addition various limits may prevent all the jobs from starting at the
expected times.
This has no impact upon the number of tasks from a job array that can be
started immediately, only those tasks expected to start at some future time.
Default: 20, Min: 0, Max: 1000.
NOTE :
Jobs submitted to multiple partitions appear in the job queue once per
partition. If different copies of a single job array record aren't consecutive
in the job queue and another job array record is in between, then
bf_max_job_array_resv tasks are considered per partition that the job is
submitted to.
bf_max_job_assoc =#[#OPT_bf_max_job_assoc](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum number of jobs per user association to attempt starting with the
backfill scheduler.
This setting is similar to bf_max_job_user but is handy if a user
has multiple associations equating to basically different users.
One can set this limit to prevent users from flooding the backfill
queue with jobs that cannot start and that prevent jobs from other users
to start.
This option applies only to SchedulerType=sched/backfill .
Also see the bf_max_job_user , bf_max_job_part ,
bf_max_job_test , and bf_max_job_user_part options.
Set bf_max_job_test to a value much higher than bf_max_job_assoc .
Default: 0 (no limit), Min: 0, Max: bf_max_job_test.
bf_max_job_part =#[#OPT_bf_max_job_part](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum number of jobs per partition to attempt starting with the backfill
scheduler. This can be especially helpful for systems with large numbers of
partitions and jobs.
This option applies only to SchedulerType=sched/backfill .
Also see the partition_job_depth and bf_max_job_test options.
Set bf_max_job_test to a value much higher than bf_max_job_part .
Default: 0 (no limit), Min: 0, Max: bf_max_job_test.
bf_max_job_start =#[#OPT_bf_max_job_start](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum number of jobs which can be initiated in a single iteration
of the backfill scheduler.
This option applies only to SchedulerType=sched/backfill .
Default: 0 (no limit), Min: 0, Max: 10000.
bf_max_job_test =#[#OPT_bf_max_job_test](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum number of jobs to attempt backfill scheduling for
(i.e. the queue depth).
Higher values result in more overhead and less responsiveness.
Until an attempt is made to backfill schedule a job, its expected
initiation time value will not be set.
In the case of large clusters, configuring a relatively small value may be
desirable.
This option applies only to SchedulerType=sched/backfill .
Default: 500, Min: 1, Max: 1,000,000.
bf_max_job_user =#[#OPT_bf_max_job_user](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum number of jobs per user to attempt starting with the backfill
scheduler for ALL partitions.
One can set this limit to prevent users from flooding the backfill
queue with jobs that cannot start and that prevent jobs from other users
to start. This is similar to the MAXIJOB limit in Maui.
This option applies only to SchedulerType=sched/backfill .
Also see the bf_max_job_part , bf_max_job_test , and
bf_max_job_user_part options.
Set bf_max_job_test to a value much higher than bf_max_job_user .
Default: 0 (no limit), Min: 0, Max: bf_max_job_test.
bf_max_job_user_part =#[#OPT_bf_max_job_user_part](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum number of jobs per user per partition to attempt starting with the
backfill scheduler for any single partition.
This option applies only to SchedulerType=sched/backfill .
Also see the bf_max_job_part , bf_max_job_test , and
bf_max_job_user options.
Default: 0 (no limit), Min: 0, Max: bf_max_job_test.
bf_max_time =#[#OPT_bf_max_time](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum time in seconds the backfill scheduler can spend (including time
spent sleeping when locks are released) before discontinuing, even if maximum
job counts have not been reached.
This option applies only to SchedulerType=sched/backfill .
The default value is the value of bf_interval (which defaults to 30 seconds).
Default: bf_interval value (def. 30 sec), Min: 1, Max: 3600 (1h).
NOTE : If bf_interval is short and bf_max_time is large, this may cause
locks to be acquired too frequently and starve out other serviced RPCs. It's
advisable if using this parameter to set max_rpc_cnt high enough that
scheduling isn't always disabled, and low enough that the interactive
workload can get through in a reasonable period of time. max_rpc_cnt needs to
be below 256 (the default RPC thread limit). Running around the middle (150)
may give you good results.
NOTE : When increasing the amount of time spent in the backfill scheduling
cycle, Slurm can be prevented from responding to client requests in a timely
manner. To address this you can use max_rpc_cnt to specify a number of
queued RPCs before the scheduler stops to respond to these requests.
bf_min_age_reserve =#[#OPT_bf_min_age_reserve](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The backfill and main scheduling logic will not reserve resources for pending
jobs until they have been pending and runnable for at least the specified
number of seconds.
In addition, jobs waiting for less than the specified number of seconds will
not prevent a newly submitted job from starting immediately, even if the newly
submitted job has a lower priority.
This can be valuable if jobs lack time limits or all time limits have the same
value.
The default value is zero, which will reserve resources for any pending job
and delay initiation of lower priority jobs.
Also see bf_job_part_count_reserve and bf_min_prio_reserve.
Default: 0, Min: 0, Max: 2592000 (30 days).
bf_min_prio_reserve =#[#OPT_bf_min_prio_reserve](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The backfill and main scheduling logic will not reserve resources for pending
jobs unless they have a priority equal to or higher than the specified value.
In addition, jobs with a lower priority will not prevent a newly submitted job
from starting immediately, even if the newly submitted job has a lower priority.
This can be valuable if one wished to maximize system utilization without regard
for job priority below a certain threshold.
The default value is zero, which will reserve resources for any pending job
and delay initiation of lower priority jobs.
Also see bf_job_part_count_reserve and bf_min_age_reserve.
Default: 0, Min: 0, Max: 2^63.
bf_node_space_size =#[#OPT_bf_node_space_size](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Size of backfill node_space table. Adding a single job to backfill reservations
in the worst case can consume two node_space records.
In the case of large clusters, configuring a relatively small value may be
desirable.
This option applies only to SchedulerType=sched/backfill .
Also see bf_max_job_test and bf_running_job_reserve.
Default: bf_max_job_test, Min: 2, Max: 2,000,000.
bf_one_resv_per_job [#OPT_bf_one_resv_per_job](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Disallow adding more than one backfill reservation per job.
The scheduling logic builds a sorted list of job-partition pairs. Jobs
submitted to multiple partitions have as many entries in the list as requested
partitions. By default, the backfill scheduler may evaluate all the
job-partition entries for a single job, potentially reserving resources for
each pair, but only starting the job in the reservation offering the earliest
start time.
Having a single job reserving resources for multiple partitions could impede
other jobs (or hetjob components) from reserving resources already reserved for
the partitions that don't offer the earliest start time.
A single job that requests multiple partitions can also prevent itself from
starting earlier in a lower priority partition if the partitions overlap
nodes and a backfill reservation in the higher priority partition blocks nodes
that are also in the lower priority partition.
This option makes it so that a job submitted to multiple partitions will stop
reserving resources once the first job-partition pair has booked a backfill
reservation. Subsequent pairs from the same job will only be tested to start
now. This allows for other jobs to be able to book the other pairs resources at
the cost of not guaranteeing that the multi partition job will start in the
partition offering the earliest start time (unless it can start immediately).
This option is disabled by default.
bf_resolution =#[#OPT_bf_resolution](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The number of seconds in the resolution of data maintained about when jobs
begin and end. Higher values result in better responsiveness and quicker
backfill cycles by using larger blocks of time to determine node eligibility.
However, higher values lead to less efficient system planning, and may miss
opportunities to improve system utilization.
This option applies only to SchedulerType=sched/backfill .
Default: 60, Min: 1, Max: 3600 (1 hour).
bf_running_job_reserve [#OPT_bf_running_job_reserve](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Add an extra step to backfill logic, which creates backfill reservations
for jobs running on whole nodes.
This option is disabled by default.
bf_topopt_enable [#OPT_bf_topopt_enable](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Enable experimental hook to control whether to delay jobs in backfill for a
better placement. Modify src/plugins/sched/backfill/oracle.c for testing.
It is recommended to disable the main scheduler so that all jobs are planned
through backfill and utilize the oracle function(). This can be done by setting
SchedulerParameters=sched_interval=-1 .
It's also recommended to run with
SchedulerParameters=bf_running_job_reserve for better planning.
bf_topopt_iterations [#OPT_bf_topopt_iterations](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The number of successive backfill map slots that a job may be delayed.
This option applies only when the bf_topopt_enable is set.
bf_window =#[#OPT_bf_window](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The number of minutes into the future to look when considering jobs to schedule.
Higher values result in more overhead and less responsiveness.
A value at least as long as the highest allowed time limit is generally
advisable to prevent job starvation.
In order to limit the amount of data managed by the backfill scheduler,
if the value of bf_window is increased, then it is generally advisable
to also increase bf_resolution .
This option applies only to SchedulerType=sched/backfill .
Default: 1440 (1 day), Min: 1, Max: 43200 (30 days).
bf_window_linear =#[#OPT_bf_window_linear](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) For performance reasons, the backfill scheduler will decrease precision in
calculation of job expected termination times. By default, the precision starts
at 30 seconds and that time interval doubles with each evaluation of currently
executing jobs when trying to determine when a pending job can start. This
algorithm can support an environment with many thousands of running jobs, but
can result in the expected start time of pending jobs being gradually being
deferred due to lack of precision. A value for bf_window_linear will cause
the time interval to be increased by a constant amount on each iteration.
The value is specified in units of seconds. For example, a value of 60 will
cause the backfill scheduler on the first iteration to identify the job ending
soonest and determine if the pending job can be started after that job plus
all other jobs expected to end within 30 seconds (default initial value) of the
first job. On the next iteration, the pending job will be evaluated for
starting after the next job expected to end plus all jobs ending within
90 seconds of that time (30 second default, plus the 60 second option value).
The third iteration will have a 150 second window and the fourth 210 seconds.
Without this option, the time windows will double on each iteration and thus
be 30, 60, 120, 240 seconds, etc. The use of bf_window_linear is not recommended
with more than a few hundred simultaneously executing jobs.
bf_yield_interval =#[#OPT_bf_yield_interval](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The backfill scheduler will periodically relinquish locks in order for other
pending operations to take place.
This specifies the times when the locks are relinquished in microseconds.
Smaller values may be helpful for high throughput computing when used in
conjunction with the bf_continue option.
Also see the bf_yield_sleep option.
Default: 2,000,000 (2 sec), Min: 1, Max: 10,000,000 (10 sec).
bf_yield_rpc_cnt [#OPT_bf_yield_rpc_cnt](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If the number of active threads in the slurmctld daemon is lower than this
value, continue scheduling of jobs. The scheduler will check this condition at
certain points in code and release previously yielded locks if necessary. This
is used to instruct Slurm when to stop processing requests and start scheduling
new jobs, which is the opposite of max_rpc_cnt . In conjunction with
max_rpc_cnt , it can improve Slurm's responsiveness to spikes of requests.
Default: MAX((max_rpc_cnt / 10), 20) (option disabled), Min: 0, Max: 200.
NOTE : If a value is set, then a value lower than max_rpc_cnt is
recommended. It may require some tuning for each system, but needs to be high
enough that scheduling isn't always disabled, and low enough that requests can
get through in a reasonable period of time. Avoid both values being close enough
to cause continuous switching between request processing and scheduling.
bf_yield_sleep =#[#OPT_bf_yield_sleep](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The backfill scheduler will periodically relinquish locks in order for other
pending operations to take place.
This specifies the length of time for which the locks are relinquished in
microseconds.
Also see the bf_yield_interval option.
Default: 500,000 (0.5 sec), Min: 1, Max: 10,000,000 (10 sec).
build_queue_timeout =#[#OPT_build_queue_timeout](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Defines the maximum time that can be devoted to building a queue of jobs to
be tested for scheduling.
If the system has a huge number of jobs with dependencies, just building the
job queue can take so much time as to adversely impact overall system
performance and this parameter can be adjusted as needed.
The default value is 2,000,000 microseconds (2 seconds).
correspond_after_task_cnt =#[#OPT_correspond_after_task_cnt](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Defines the number of array tasks that get split for potential aftercorr
dependency check. Low number may result in dependent task check failures when
the job one depends on gets purged before the split.
Default: 10.
default_queue_depth =#[#OPT_default_queue_depth](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The default number of jobs to attempt scheduling (i.e. the queue depth) when a
running job completes or other routine actions occur, however the frequency
with which the scheduler is run may be limited by using the defer or
sched_min_interval parameters described below.
The main scheduling loop will run (ignoring this limit)
on a less frequent basis as defined by the
sched_interval option described below. The default value is 100.
See the partition_job_depth option to limit depth by partition.
defer [#OPT_defer](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Setting this option will avoid attempting to schedule each job
individually at job submit time, but defer it until a later time when
scheduling multiple jobs simultaneously may be possible.
This option may improve system responsiveness when large numbers of jobs
(many hundreds) are submitted at the same time, but it will delay the
initiation time of individual jobs. Also see default_queue_depth above.
defer_batch [#OPT_defer_batch](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Like defer , but only will defer scheduling for batch jobs. Interactive
allocations from salloc/srun will still attempt to schedule immediately upon
submission.
delay_boot =#[#OPT_delay_boot](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Do not reboot nodes in order to satisfied this job's feature specification if
the job has been eligible to run for less than this time period.
If the job has waited for less than the specified period, it will use only
nodes which already have the specified features.
The argument is in units of minutes.
Individual jobs may override this default value with the --delay-boot
option.
disable_job_shrink [#OPT_disable_job_shrink](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Deny user requests to shrink the size of running jobs. (However, running jobs
may still shrink due to node failure if the --no-kill option was set.)
disable_hetjob_steps [#OPT_disable_hetjob_steps](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Disable job steps that span heterogeneous job allocations.
enable_hetjob_steps [#OPT_enable_hetjob_steps](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Enable job steps that span heterogeneous job allocations.
The default value.
enable_job_state_cache [#OPT_enable_job_state_cache](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Enables an independent cache of job state details within slurmctld. This allows
processing of ` squeue --only-job-state` and replaced RPCs with minimal
impact on other slurmctld operations.
enable_user_top [#OPT_enable_user_top](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Enable use of the "scontrol top" command by non-privileged users.
extra_constraints [#OPT_extra_constraints](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Enable node filtering with the --extra option for salloc, sbatch, and srun
and the node's Extra field.
ignore_constraint_validation [#OPT_ignore_constraint_validation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, and a job requests --constraint any features in the request that would
create an invalid request with the current system will not generate an error.
This is helpful for dynamic systems where nodes with features come and go.
Jobs will remain in the job queue until the requested feature is in the cluster
and available.
Please note using this option will not protect you from typos.
See also ignore_prefer_validation.
Ignore_NUMA [#OPT_Ignore_NUMA](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Some processors (e.g. AMD Opteron 6000 series) contain multiple NUMA nodes per
socket. This is a configuration which does not map into the hardware entities
that Slurm optimizes resource allocation for (PU/thread, core, socket,
baseboard, node and network switch). In order to optimize resource allocations
on such hardware, Slurm will consider each NUMA node within the socket as a
separate socket by default. Use the Ignore_NUMA option to report the correct
socket count, but not optimize resource allocations on the NUMA nodes.
NOTE : Since hwloc 2.0 NUMA Nodes are are not part of the main/CPU topology tree,
because of that if Slurm is build with hwloc 2.0 or above Slurm will treat
HWLOC_OBJ_PACKAGE as Socket, you can change this behavior using
SlurmdParameters =l3cache_as_socket.
ignore_prefer_validation [#OPT_ignore_prefer_validation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, and a job requests --prefer any features in the request that would
create an invalid request with the current system will not generate an error.
This is helpful for dynamic systems where nodes with features come and go.
Please note using this option will not protect you from typos.
See also ignore_constraint_validation.
max_array_tasks [#OPT_max_array_tasks](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specify the maximum number of tasks that can be included in a job array.
The default limit is MaxArraySize, but this option can be used to set a lower
limit. For example, max_array_tasks=1000 and MaxArraySize=100001 would permit
a maximum task ID of 100000, but limit the number of tasks in any single job
array to 1000.
max_rpc_cnt =#[#OPT_max_rpc_cnt](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If the number of active threads in the slurmctld daemon is equal to or
larger than this value, defer scheduling of jobs. The scheduler will check
this condition at certain points in code and yield locks if necessary.
This can improve Slurm's ability to process requests at a cost of initiating
new jobs less frequently. Default: 0 (option disabled), Min: 0, Max: 1000.
NOTE : The maximum number of threads (MAX_SERVER_THREADS) is internally set
to 256 and defines the number of served RPCs at a given time. Setting max_rpc_cnt
to more than 256 will be only useful to let backfill continue scheduling work
after locks have been yielded (i.e. each 2 seconds) if there are a maximum of
MAX(max_rpc_cnt/10, 20) RPCs in the queue. i.e. max_rpc_cnt=1000, the scheduler
will be allowed to continue after yielding locks only when there are less than
or equal to 100 pending RPCs.
If a value is set, then a value of 10 or higher is recommended. It may require
some tuning for each system, but needs to be high enough that scheduling isn't
always disabled, and low enough that requests can get through in a reasonable
period of time.
max_sched_time =#[#OPT_max_sched_time](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) How long, in seconds, the main scheduling loop will run before exiting.
Note that all other Slurm operations, including responses to RPCs, will be
deferred while the scheduling loop is running.
Defaults to 2 seconds in most cases, or 1 second if MessageTimeout is set
to 3 or less. The maximum value is half of MessageTimeout . Larger values
will be replaced with the applicable default value.
NOTE : A higher value will allow the main scheduler to evaluate more
pending jobs per cycle. If this timeout is reached, some low priority pending
jobs will not be evaluated, which can leave their reason for pending as 'None'
until they can be evaluated in a future scheduling cycle.
max_script_size =#[#OPT_max_script_size](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specify the maximum size of a batch script, in bytes.
The default value is 4 megabytes.
Larger values may adversely impact system performance.
max_submit_line_size =#[#OPT_max_submit_line_size](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specify the maximum size of a submit line, in bytes.
The default value is 1 megabtye.
This option cannot exceed 2 megabytes.
max_switch_wait =#[#OPT_max_switch_wait](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Maximum number of seconds that a job can delay execution waiting for the
specified desired switch count. The default value is 300 seconds.
no_backup_scheduling [#OPT_no_backup_scheduling](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If used, the backup controller will not schedule jobs when it takes over. The
backup controller will allow jobs to be submitted, modified and cancelled but
won't schedule new jobs. This is useful in Cray environments when the backup
controller resides on an external Cray node.
nohold_on_prolog_fail [#OPT_nohold_on_prolog_fail](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) By default, if the Prolog exits with a non-zero value the job is requeued in
a held state. By specifying this parameter the job will be requeued but not
held so that the scheduler can dispatch it to another host.
pack_serial_at_end [#OPT_pack_serial_at_end](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If used with the select/cons_tres plugin,
then put serial jobs at the end of
the available nodes rather than using a best fit algorithm.
This may reduce resource fragmentation for some workloads.
partition_job_depth =#[#OPT_partition_job_depth](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The default number of jobs to attempt scheduling (i.e. the queue depth)
from each partition/queue in Slurm's main scheduling logic.
This limit will be enforced for all main scheduler cycles.
The functionality is similar to that provided by the bf_max_job_part
option for the backfill scheduling logic.
The default value is 0 (no limit).
Job's excluded from attempted scheduling based upon partition will not be
counted against the default_queue_depth limit.
Also see the bf_max_job_part option.
reduce_completing_frag [#OPT_reduce_completing_frag](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) This option is used to control how scheduling of resources is performed when
jobs are in the COMPLETING state, which influences potential fragmentation.
If this option is not set then no jobs will be started in any partition when
any job is in the COMPLETING state for less than CompleteWait seconds.
If this option is set then no jobs will be started in any individual partition
that has a job in COMPLETING state for less than CompleteWait seconds.
In addition, no jobs will be started in any partition with nodes that overlap
with any nodes in the partition of the completing job.
This option is to be used in conjunction with CompleteWait .
NOTE : CompleteWait must be set in order for this to work. If
CompleteWait=0 then this option does nothing.
NOTE : reduce_completing_frag only affects the main scheduler, not
the backfill scheduler.
requeue_delay= [#OPT_requeue_delay=](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Delay before a non-Expedited Requeue job is eligible to run after being
requeued. Defaults to the AuthInfo=cred_expire setting, which itself defaults
to 120 seconds.
requeue_on_resume_failure [#OPT_requeue_on_resume_failure](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) In the event that nodes fail to resume by ResumeTimeout , all batch jobs
will be requeued -- even if the jobs requested not to be requeued. This is
similar to PrologFlags=ForceRequeueOnFail .
salloc_wait_nodes [#OPT_salloc_wait_nodes](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If defined, the salloc command will wait until all allocated nodes are ready for
use (i.e. booted) before the command returns. By default, salloc will return as
soon as the resource allocation has been made. The salloc command can use the
--wait-all-nodes option to override this configuration parameter.
sbatch_wait_nodes [#OPT_sbatch_wait_nodes](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If defined, the sbatch script will wait until all allocated nodes are ready for
use (i.e. booted) before the initiation. By default, the sbatch script will be
initiated as soon as the first node in the job allocation is ready. The sbatch
command can use the --wait-all-nodes option to override this configuration
parameter.
sched_interval =#[#OPT_sched_interval](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) How frequently, in seconds, the main scheduling loop will execute and test all
pending jobs, with only the partition_job_depth limit in place.
The default value is 60 seconds.
A setting of -1 will disable the main scheduling loop.
sched_max_job_start =#[#OPT_sched_max_job_start](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum number of jobs that the main scheduling logic will start in any
single execution.
The default value is zero, which imposes no limit.
sched_min_interval =#[#OPT_sched_min_interval](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) How frequently, in microseconds, the main scheduling loop will execute and test
any pending jobs.
The scheduler runs in a limited fashion every time that any event happens which
could enable a job to start (e.g. job submit, job terminate, etc.).
If these events happen at a high frequency, the scheduler can run very
frequently and consume significant resources if not throttled by this option.
This option specifies the minimum time between the end of one scheduling
cycle and the beginning of the next scheduling cycle.
A value of zero will disable throttling of the scheduling logic interval.
The default value is 2 microseconds.
spec_cores_first [#OPT_spec_cores_first](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specialized cores will be selected from the first cores of the first sockets,
cycling through the sockets on a round robin basis.
By default, specialized cores will be selected from the last cores of the
last sockets, cycling through the sockets on a round robin basis.
step_retry_count =#[#OPT_step_retry_count](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) When a step completes and there are steps ending resource allocation, then
retry step allocations for at least this number of pending steps.
Also see step_retry_time .
The default value is 8 steps.
step_retry_time =#[#OPT_step_retry_time](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) When a step completes and there are steps ending resource allocation, then
retry step allocations for all steps which have been pending for at least this
number of seconds.
Also see step_retry_count .
The default value is 60 seconds.
time_min_as_soft_limit [#OPT_time_min_as_soft_limit](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Treat the --time-min limit as a soft time limit for the job. Scheduling
will plan for the shorter duration, while permitting the job to continue
running until the ("hard") --time limit.
whole_hetjob [#OPT_whole_hetjob](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Requests to cancel, hold or release any component of a heterogeneous job will
be applied to all components of the job.
NOTE : This option was previously named whole_pack and this is still
supported for backwards compatibility.
SchedulerTimeSlice [#OPT_SchedulerTimeSlice](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Number of seconds in each time slice when gang scheduling is enabled
( PreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG ).
The value must be between 5 seconds and 65533 seconds.
The default value is 30 seconds.
SchedulerType [#OPT_SchedulerType](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Identifies the type of scheduler to be used.
The scontrol command can be used to manually change job priorities
if desired.
Acceptable values include:
sched/backfill [#OPT_sched/backfill](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) For a backfill scheduling module to augment the default FIFO scheduling.
Backfill scheduling will initiate lower-priority jobs if doing
so does not delay the expected initiation time of any higher
priority job.
Effectiveness of backfill scheduling is dependent upon users specifying
job time limits, otherwise all jobs will have the same time limit and
backfilling is impossible.
Note documentation for the SchedulerParameters option above.
This is the default configuration.
sched/builtin [#OPT_sched/builtin](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) This is the FIFO scheduler which initiates jobs in priority order.
If any job in the partition can not be scheduled, no lower priority job in that
partition will be scheduled.
An exception is made for jobs that can not run due to partition constraints
(e.g. the time limit) or down/drained nodes.
In that case, lower priority jobs can be initiated and not impact the higher
priority job. Setting this scheduler type will disable heterogeneous jobs, since
they are handled by the backfill scheduler.
ScronParameters [#OPT_ScronParameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Multiple options may be comma separated.
enable [#OPT_enable](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Enable the use of scrontab to submit and manage periodic repeating jobs.
explicit_scancel [#OPT_explicit_scancel](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) When cancelling an scrontab job, require the user to explicitly request
cancelling the job with the --cron flag in scancel.
SelectType [#OPT_SelectType_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Identifies the type of resource selection algorithm to be used.
When changed, all job information (running and pending) will be
lost, since the job state save format used by each plugin is different.
The only exception to this is when changing from the legacy cons_res to
cons_tres.
Acceptable values include
select/cons_tres [#OPT_select/cons_tres](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The resources (cores, memory, GPUs and all other trackable resources) within
a node are individually allocated as consumable resources.
Note that whole nodes can be allocated to jobs for selected
partitions by using the OverSubscribe=Exclusive option.
See the partition OverSubscribe parameter for more information.
This is the default value.
select/linear [#OPT_select/linear](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) for allocation of entire nodes assuming a one-dimensional array of nodes in
which sequentially ordered nodes are preferable.
For a heterogeneous cluster (e.g. different CPU counts on the various nodes),
resource allocations will favor nodes with high CPU counts as needed based upon
the job's node and CPU specification if TopologyPlugin=topology/flat is
configured. Use of other topology plugins with select/linear and heterogeneous
nodes is not recommended and may result in valid job allocation requests being
rejected. The linear plugin is not designed to track generic resources on a
node. In cases where generic resources (such as GPUs) need to be tracked,
the cons_tres plugin should be used instead.
SelectTypeParameters [#OPT_SelectTypeParameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The permitted values of SelectTypeParameters depend upon the
configured value of SelectType .
The only supported options for SelectType=select/linear are
CR_ONE_TASK_PER_CORE and
CR_Memory , which treats memory as a consumable resource and
prevents memory over subscription with job preemption or gang scheduling.
By default SelectType=select/linear allocates whole nodes to jobs without
considering their memory consumption.
By default SelectType=select/cons_tres uses CR_Core_Memory , which
allocates Core to jobs while considering their memory consumption.
The following options are supported by the SelectType=select/cons_tres
plugin:
CR_CPU [#OPT_CR_CPU](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) CPUs are consumable resources.
Configure the number of CPUs on each node, which may be equal to the
count of cores or hyper-threads on the node depending upon the desired minimum
resource allocation.
The node's Boards , Sockets , CoresPerSocket and
ThreadsPerCore may optionally be configured and result in job
allocations which have improved locality; however doing so will prevent
more than one job from being allocated on each core.
CR_CPU_Memory [#OPT_CR_CPU_Memory](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) CPUs and memory are consumable resources.
Configure the number of CPUs on each node, which may be equal to the
count of cores or hyper-threads on the node depending upon the desired minimum
resource allocation.
The node's Boards , Sockets , CoresPerSocket and
ThreadsPerCore may optionally be configured and result in job
allocations which have improved locality; however doing so will prevent
more than one job from being allocated on each core.
Setting a value for DefMemPerCPU is strongly recommended.
CR_Core [#OPT_CR_Core](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Cores are consumable resources.
On nodes with hyper-threads, each thread is counted as a CPU to
satisfy a job's resource requirement, but multiple jobs are not
allocated threads on the same core.
The count of CPUs allocated to a job is rounded up to account for every
CPU on an allocated core. This will also impact total allocated memory when
--mem-per-cpu is used to be multiply of total number of CPUs on allocated cores.
CR_Core_Memory [#OPT_CR_Core_Memory](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Cores and memory are consumable resources.
On nodes with hyper-threads, each thread is counted as a CPU to
satisfy a job's resource requirement, but multiple jobs are not
allocated threads on the same core.
The count of CPUs allocated to a job may be rounded up to account for every
CPU on an allocated core.
Setting a value for DefMemPerCPU is strongly recommended.
CR_ONE_TASK_PER_CORE [#OPT_CR_ONE_TASK_PER_CORE](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Allocate one task per core by default.
Without this option, by default one task will be allocated per
thread on nodes with more than one ThreadsPerCore configured.
NOTE : This option cannot be used with CR_CPU*.
CR_CORE_DEFAULT_DIST_BLOCK [#OPT_CR_CORE_DEFAULT_DIST_BLOCK](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Allocate cores within a node using block distribution by default.
This is a pseudo-best-fit algorithm that minimizes the number of
boards and minimizes the number of sockets (within minimum boards)
used for the allocation.
This default behavior can be overridden specifying a particular
"-m" parameter with srun/salloc/sbatch.
Without this option, cores will be allocated cyclically across the sockets.
CR_LLN [#OPT_CR_LLN](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Schedule resources to jobs on the least loaded nodes (based upon the number
of idle CPUs). This is generally only recommended for an environment with
serial jobs as idle resources will tend to be highly fragmented, resulting
in parallel jobs being distributed across many nodes.
Note that node Weight takes precedence over how many idle resources are
on each node.
Also see the partition configuration parameter LLN
use the least loaded nodes in selected partitions.
CR_Pack_Nodes [#OPT_CR_Pack_Nodes](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If a job allocation contains more resources than will be used for launching
tasks (e.g. if whole nodes are allocated to a job), then rather than
distributing a job's tasks evenly across its allocated nodes, pack them as
tightly as possible on these nodes.
For example, consider a job allocation containing two entire nodes with
eight CPUs each.
If the job starts ten tasks across those two nodes without this option, it will
start five tasks on each of the two nodes.
With this option, eight tasks will be started on the first node and two tasks
on the second node.
This can be superseded by "NoPack" in srun's "--distribution" option.
CR_Pack_Nodes only applies when the "block" task distribution method is used.
LL_SHARED_GRES [#OPT_LL_SHARED_GRES](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) When allocating resources for a shared GRES (gres/mps, gres/shard), prefer
least loaded device (in terms of already allocated fraction). This way jobs are
spread across GRES devices on the node, instead of the default behavior where
the first available device is used.
This option is only supported by select/cons_tres plugin.
CR_Socket [#OPT_CR_Socket](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Sockets are consumable resources.
On nodes with multiple cores, each core or thread is counted as a CPU
to satisfy a job's resource requirement, but multiple jobs are not
allocated resources on the same socket.
CR_Socket_Memory [#OPT_CR_Socket_Memory](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Memory and sockets are consumable resources.
On nodes with multiple cores, each core or thread is counted as a CPU
to satisfy a job's resource requirement, but multiple jobs are not
allocated resources on the same socket.
Setting a value for DefMemPerCPU is strongly recommended.
MULTIPLE_SHARING_GRES_PJ [#OPT_MULTIPLE_SHARING_GRES_PJ](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) By default, only one sharing gres per job is allowed on each node from shared
gres requests. This allows multiple sharing gres' to be used on a single node
to satisfy shared gres requirements per job.
Example: If there are 10 shards to a gpu and 12 shards are requested, instead of
being denied the job will be allocated with 2 gpus. 1 using 10 shards and the
other using 2 shards.
ENFORCE_BINDING_GRES [#OPT_ENFORCE_BINDING_GRES](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Set --gres-flags=enforce-binding as the default in every job.
This can be overridden with --gres-flags=disable-binding .
ONE_TASK_PER_SHARING_GRES [#OPT_ONE_TASK_PER_SHARING_GRES](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Set --gres-flags=one-task-per-sharing as the default in every job.
This can be overridden with --gres-flags=multiple-tasks-per-sharing .
NOTE : If memory isn't configured as a consumable resource (CR_CPU,
CR_Core or CR_Socket without _Memory) memory can be oversubscribed and will not
be constrained by task/cgroup even if it is configured in cgroup.conf. In this
case the --mem option is only used to filter out nodes with lower
configured memory and does not take running jobs into account. For instance,
two jobs requesting all the memory of a node can run at the same time.
SlurmctldAddr [#OPT_SlurmctldAddr](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) An optional address to be used for communications to the currently active
slurmctld daemon, normally used with Virtual IP addressing of the currently
active server.
If this parameter is not specified then each primary and backup server will
have its own unique address used for communications as specified in the
SlurmctldHost parameter.
If this parameter is specified then the SlurmctldHost parameter will
still be used for communications to specific slurmctld primary or backup
servers, for example to cause all of them to read the current configuration
files or shutdown.
Also see the SlurmctldPrimaryOffProg and SlurmctldPrimaryOnProg
configuration parameters to configure programs to manipulate virtual IP
address manipulation.
SlurmctldDebug [#OPT_SlurmctldDebug](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The level of detail to provide slurmctld daemon's logs.
The default value is info .
If the slurmctld daemon is initiated with -v or --verbose options,
that debug level will be preserved or restored upon reconfiguration.
quiet [#OPT_quiet](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Log nothing
fatal [#OPT_fatal](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Log only fatal errors
error [#OPT_error](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Log only errors
info [#OPT_info](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Log errors and general informational messages
verbose [#OPT_verbose](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Log errors and verbose informational messages
debug [#OPT_debug](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Log errors and verbose informational messages and debugging messages
debug2 [#OPT_debug2](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Log errors and verbose informational messages and more debugging messages
debug3 [#OPT_debug3](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Log errors and verbose informational messages and even more debugging messages
debug4 [#OPT_debug4](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Log errors and verbose informational messages and even more debugging messages
debug5 [#OPT_debug5](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Log errors and verbose informational messages and even more debugging messages
SlurmctldHost [#OPT_SlurmctldHost](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The short, or long, hostname of the machine where Slurm control daemon is
executed (i.e. the name returned by the command "hostname -s").
This hostname is optionally followed by either the IP address or
a name by which the address can be identified, enclosed in parentheses. e.g.
```text
SlurmctldHost=slurmctl-primary(12.34.56.78)
```
Each host running an instance of slurmctld should have a SlurmctldHost=
entry. e.g.
```text
SlurmctldHost=slurmctl-primary1 SlurmctldHost=slurmctl-primary2 SlurmctldHost=slurmctl-primary3(12.34.56.78)
```
SlurmctldHost must be specified at least once. If specified more than once, the
first entry will run as the primary and all other entries as standby backups.
If the primary host fails, the first backup will change from standby to primary
until the first host comes back online. This same process will repeat if the new
primary fails.
Slurm daemons need to be reconfigured (e.g. "scontrol reconfig") for changes to
this parameter to take effect. It is okay for jobs to be running when making
these changes, as the running steps will get the updated SlurmctldHost info.
Every slurmctld host controller must have access to the StateSaveLocation
directory, which must be readable and writable from the primary and all backup
controllers at all times.
Refer to the RELOCATING CONTROLLERS section if you need to change this.
SlurmctldLogFile [#OPT_SlurmctldLogFile](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Fully qualified pathname of a file into which the slurmctld daemon's
logs are written.
The default value is none (performs logging via syslog).
See the section LOGGING if a pathname is specified.
SlurmctldParameters [#OPT_SlurmctldParameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Multiple options may be comma separated.
allow_user_triggers [#OPT_allow_user_triggers](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Permit setting triggers from non-root/slurm_user users. SlurmUser must also
be set to root to permit these triggers to work. See the strigger man
page for additional details.
cloud_dns [#OPT_cloud_dns](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) By default, Slurm expects that the network address for a cloud node won't
be known until the creation of the node and that Slurm will be notified of the
node's address (e.g. scontrol update nodename=<name> nodeaddr=<addr> ).
Since Slurm communications rely on the node configuration found in the
slurm.conf, Slurm will tell the client command, after waiting for all nodes to
boot, each node's ip address. However, in environments where the nodes are in
DNS, this step can be avoided by configuring this option.
conmgr_max_connections = <connection_count> [#OPT_conmgr_max_connections](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specify the maximum number of connections to be processed at any given time.
This does not influence the maximum number of pending connections as that is
controlled by the kernel. Increasing this value will increase slurmctld 's
memory footprint. Sites are advised to monitor memory consumption when
increasing this value. Defaults to 512.
conmgr_threads = <thread_count> [#OPT_conmgr_threads](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The number of process threads in thread pool used for receiving and
processing connections on the listening sockets. In most cases, you should
decrease conmgr_threads to improve scheduling performance.
conmgr_use_poll [#OPT_conmgr_use_poll](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Use [poll](https://slurm.schedmd.com/poll.html) (2) instead of [epoll](https://slurm.schedmd.com/epoll.html) (7) for monitoring file descriptors.
conmgr_connect_timeout = <seconds> [#OPT_conmgr_connect_timeout](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Wait <seconds> before considering an outbound connection attempt to be
timed out. Defaults to the value of MessageTimeout .
conmgr_read_timeout = <seconds> [#OPT_conmgr_read_timeout](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Wait <seconds> before considering a read from a file descriptor to be
timed out. Defaults to the value of MessageTimeout .
conmgr_quiesce_timeout = <seconds> [#OPT_conmgr_quiesce_timeout](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Wait <seconds> before considering quiesce to be timed out. Upon timeout,
all (non-listening) active connections will be closed to allow the quiesce to
start. Defaults to two times value of MessageTimeout .
conmgr_wait_write_delay = <seconds> [#OPT_conmgr_wait_write_delay](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) When waiting for kernel to flush outgoing buffer, poll kernel for changes every
<seconds> for changes. Defaults to the value of MessageTimeout .
conmgr_write_timeout = <seconds> [#OPT_conmgr_write_timeout](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Wait <seconds> before considering a write from a file descriptor to be
timed out. Defaults to the value of MessageTimeout .
disable_triggers [#OPT_disable_triggers](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Disable the ability to register new triggers.
enable_async_reply [#OPT_enable_async_reply](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Enable slurmctld to reply to incoming (supported) RPCs asynchronously
without blocking a thread in the conmgr thread pool.
enable_configless [#OPT_enable_configless](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Permit "configless" operation by the slurmd, slurmstepd, and user commands.
When enabled the slurmd will be permitted to retrieve config files and
Prolog , Epilog , TaskProlog , and TaskEpilog scripts from
the slurmctld, and on any 'scontrol reconfigure' command new configs and scripts
will be automatically pushed out and applied to nodes that are running in this
"configless" mode. See [https://slurm.schedmd.com/configless_slurm.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/configless_slurm.html) for more
details.
NOTE : Included files with the Include directive will only be pushed
if the filename has no path separators and is located adjacent to slurm.conf.
NOTE : Prolog and Epilog scripts will only be pushed if the
filenames have no path separators and are located adjacent to slurm.conf.
Glob patterns (See glob (7)) are not supported.
enable_expedited_requeue [#OPT_enable_expedited_requeue](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Allow jobs to request an expedited requeue on certain events. An expedited
requeue ensures that the job is immediately eligible to run and gets placed at
the top of the queue.
idle_on_node_suspend [#OPT_idle_on_node_suspend](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Mark nodes as idle, regardless of current state, when suspending nodes with
SuspendProgram so that nodes will be eligible to be resumed at a later
time.
node_reg_mem_percent =#[#OPT_node_reg_mem_percent](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Percentage of memory a node is allowed to register with without being marked as
invalid with low memory. Default is 100. For State=CLOUD nodes, the default is
90. To disable this for cloud nodes set it to 100. config_overrides takes
precedence over this option.
It's recommended that task/cgroup with ConstrainRamSpace is
configured. A memory cgroup limit won't be set more than the actual memory on
the node. If needed, configure AllowedRamSpace in the cgroup.conf to add
a buffer.
no_quick_restart [#OPT_no_quick_restart](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) By default starting a new instance of the slurmctld will kill the old one
running before taking control. If this option is set this will not happen
without the -i option.
power_save_interval [#OPT_power_save_interval](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) How often the power_save thread looks to resume and suspend nodes. The
power_save thread will do work sooner if there are node state changes. Default
is 10 seconds.
power_save_min_interval [#OPT_power_save_min_interval](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) How often the power_save thread, at a minimum, looks to resume and suspend
nodes. Default is 0.
max_powered_nodes [#OPT_max_powered_nodes](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The max number of powered up nodes across the cluster. Once this is reached,
jobs requesting additional nodes will not start, and "scontrol power up
<nodes>" will fail.
max_dbd_msg_action [#OPT_max_dbd_msg_action](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Action used once MaxDBDMsgs is reached, options are 'discard' (default) and 'exit'.
When 'discard' is specified and MaxDBDMsgs is reached we start by purging
pending messages of types Step start and complete, and it reaches MaxDBDMsgs
again Job start messages are purged. Job completes and node state changes
continue to consume the empty space created from the purgings until MaxDBDMsgs
is reached again at which no new message is tracked creating data loss and
potentially runaway jobs.
When 'exit' is specified and MaxDBDMsgs is reached the slurmctld will exit
instead of discarding any messages. It will be impossible to start the
slurmctld with this option where the slurmdbd is down and the slurmctld is
tracking more than MaxDBDMsgs.
reboot_from_controller [#OPT_reboot_from_controller](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Run the RebootProgram from the controller instead of on the slurmds. The
RebootProgram will be passed a comma-separated list of nodes to reboot as the
first argument and if applicable the required features needed for reboot as the
second argument.
reconfig_on_restart [#OPT_reconfig_on_restart](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Every restart of slurmctld (process restart not triggered by "scontrol
reconfigure") will trigger a reconfiguration request to all slurmd and sackd
daemons. For "configless" systems this will ensure all processes are running
the current configuration.
NOTE : Use with caution when performing rolling upgrades as this could
inadvertently trigger an upgrade of the slurmd or sackd daemons earlier than
intended.
rl_bucket_size =[#OPT_rl_bucket_size](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Size of the token bucket. This permits a certain amount of RPC burst from a
user before the steady-state rate limit takes effect.
The default value is 30.
rl_enable [#OPT_rl_enable](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Enable per-user RPC rate-limiting support. Client-commands will be told to
back off and sleep for a second once the limit has been reached.
This is implemented as a "token bucket", which permits a certain degree of
"bursty" RPC load from an individual user before holding them to a
steady-state RPC load established by the refill period and rate.
rl_log_freq =[#OPT_rl_log_freq](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The maximum frequency (in seconds) for which logs about RPC limit being exceeded
by an individual user are printed to the logs. Set to 0 to see every incidence.
Set to -1 to disable the log message entirely.
The default value is 0.
rl_refill_period =[#OPT_rl_refill_period](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) How frequently, in seconds, in which additional tokens are added to each user
bucket.
The default value is 1.
rl_refill_rate =[#OPT_rl_refill_rate](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) How many tokens to add to the bucket on each period.
The default value is 2.
rl_table_size =[#OPT_rl_table_size](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Number of entries in the user hash-table. Recommended value should be at least
twice the number of active user accounts on the system.
The default value is 8192.
enable_stepmgr [#OPT_enable_stepmgr](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Enable slurmstepd step management system wide. This enables job steps to be
managed by a single extern slurmstepd associated with the job to manage steps.
This is beneficial for jobs that submit many steps inside their allocations.
PrologFlags=contain must be set.
user_resv_delete [#OPT_user_resv_delete](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Allow any user able to run in a reservation to delete it.
validate_nodeaddr_threads =[#OPT_validate_nodeaddr_threads](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) During startup, slurmctld looks up the address for each compute node in the
system. On large systems this can cause considerable delay, this option permits
the slurmctld to concurrently handle the lookup calls and can reduce system
startup time considerably. The default value is 1. Maximum permitted value is
64.
SlurmctldPidFile [#OPT_SlurmctldPidFile](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Fully qualified pathname of a file into which the slurmctld daemon
may write its process id. This may be used for automated signal processing.
The default value is "/var/run/slurmctld.pid".
SlurmctldPort [#OPT_SlurmctldPort](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The port number that the Slurm controller, slurmctld , listens
to for work. The default value is SLURMCTLD_PORT as established at system
build time. If none is explicitly specified, it will be set to 6817.
SlurmctldPort may also be configured to support a range of port
numbers for existing legacy configurations.
NOTE : Either slurmctld and slurmd daemons must not
execute on the same nodes or the values of SlurmctldPort and
SlurmdPort must be different.
NOTE : On Cray systems, Realm-Specific IP Addressing (RSIP) will
automatically try to interact with anything opened on ports 8192-60000.
Configure SlurmctldPort to use a port outside of the configured SrunPortRange
and RSIP's port range.
SlurmctldPrimaryOffProg [#OPT_SlurmctldPrimaryOffProg](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) This program is executed when a slurmctld daemon running as the primary server
becomes a backup server. The controller will wait for this script to end before
fully shutting down. By default no program is executed.
See also the related "SlurmctldPrimaryOnProg" parameter.
SlurmctldPrimaryOnProg [#OPT_SlurmctldPrimaryOnProg](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) This program is executed when a slurmctld daemon running as a backup server
becomes the primary server. The controller will wait for this script to end
before fully starting up. By default no program is executed.
When using virtual IP addresses to manage High Available Slurm services,
this program can be used to add the IP address to an interface (and optionally
try to kill the unresponsive slurmctld daemon and flush the ARP caches on
nodes on the local Ethernet fabric).
See also the related "SlurmctldPrimaryOffProg" parameter.
SlurmctldSyslogDebug [#OPT_SlurmctldSyslogDebug](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The slurmctld daemon will log events to the syslog file at the specified
level of detail. If not set, the slurmctld daemon will log to syslog at
level fatal , unless there is no SlurmctldLogFile and it is running
in the background, in which case it will log to syslog at the level specified
by SlurmctldDebug (at fatal in the case that SlurmctldDebug
is set to quiet ) or it is run in the foreground, when it will be set to
quiet.
quiet [#OPT_quiet_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Log nothing
fatal [#OPT_fatal_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Log only fatal errors

debug5 [#OPT_debug5_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Log errors and verbose informational messages and even more debugging messages
NOTE : By default, Slurm's systemd service file starts the slurmctld daemon
in the foreground with the --systemd option. This means that systemd will
capture stdout/stderr output and print that to syslog, independent of Slurm
printing to syslog directly. To prevent systemd from doing this, add
"StandardOutput=null" and "StandardError=null" to the respective service files
or override files.
SlurmctldTimeout [#OPT_SlurmctldTimeout](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The interval, in seconds, that the backup controller waits for the
primary controller to respond before assuming control.
The default value is 120 seconds.

The first "%h" within the name is replaced with the hostname on which the
slurmd is running.
The first "%n" within the name is replaced with the Slurm node name on which the
slurmd is running.
See the section LOGGING if a pathname is specified.
SlurmdParameters [#OPT_SlurmdParameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Parameters specific to the Slurmd.
Multiple options may be comma separated.
NOTE : Additional node-specific parameters can be specified using the
Parameters option in individual node definitions.
allow_ecores [#OPT_allow_ecores](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, and processors on your nodes have E-Cores, allows them to be used in
for scheduling and task placement. (By default, E-Cores are ignored.)
config_overrides [#OPT_config_overrides](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, consider the configuration of each node to be that specified in the
slurm.conf configuration file and any node with less than the
configured resources will not be set to INVAL/INVALID_REG.
This option is generally only useful for testing purposes.
Equivalent to the now deprecated FastSchedule=2 option.
conmgr_max_connections = <connection_count> [#OPT_conmgr_max_connections_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specify the maximum number of connections to be processed at any given time.
This does not influence the maximum number of pending connections as that is
controlled by the kernel. Increasing this value will increase slurmd 's
memory footprint. Sites are advised to monitor memory consumption when
increasing this value. Defaults to 50.
conmgr_threads = <thread_count> [#OPT_conmgr_threads_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The number of process threads in thread pool used for receiving and
processing connections on the listening sockets. In most cases you should
decrease conmgr_threads to improve scheduling performance.
Default value is 6 threads.
conmgr_use_poll [#OPT_conmgr_use_poll_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Use [poll](https://slurm.schedmd.com/poll.html) (2) instead of [epoll](https://slurm.schedmd.com/epoll.html) (7) for monitoring file descriptors.
conmgr_connect_timeout = <seconds> [#OPT_conmgr_connect_timeout_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Wait <seconds> before considering an outbound connection attempt to be
timed out. Defaults to the value of MessageTimeout .
conmgr_read_timeout = <seconds> [#OPT_conmgr_read_timeout_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Wait <seconds> before considering a read from a file descriptor to be
timed out. Defaults to the value of MessageTimeout .
conmgr_quiesce_timeout = <seconds> [#OPT_conmgr_quiesce_timeout_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Wait <seconds> before considering quiesce to be timed out. Upon timeout,
all (non-listening) active connections will be closed to allow the quiesce to
start. Defaults to two times value of MessageTimeout .
conmgr_wait_write_delay = <seconds> [#OPT_conmgr_wait_write_delay_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) When waiting for kernel to flush outgoing buffer, poll kernel for changes every
<seconds> for changes. Defaults to the value of MessageTimeout .
conmgr_write_timeout = <seconds> [#OPT_conmgr_write_timeout_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Wait <seconds> before considering a write from a file descriptor to be
timed out. Defaults to the value of MessageTimeout .
l3cache_as_socket [#OPT_l3cache_as_socket](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Use the hwloc l3cache as the socket count. Can be useful on certain processors
where the socket level is too coarse, and the l3cache may provide better
task distribution. (E.g., along CCX boundaries instead of socket boundaries.)
Mutually exclusive with numa_node_as_socket.
Requires hwloc v2.
numa_node_as_socket [#OPT_numa_node_as_socket](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Use the hwloc NUMA Node to determine main hierarchy object to be used as socket.
If the option is set Slurm will check the parent object of NUMA Node and use it
as socket. This option may be useful for architectures likes AMD Epyc, where
number of nodes per socket may be configured.
Mutually exclusive with l3cache_as_socket.
Requires hwloc v2.
shutdown_on_reboot [#OPT_shutdown_on_reboot](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, the Slurmd will shut itself down when a reboot request is received.
contain_spank [#OPT_contain_spank](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set and a namespace plugin is specified, the spank_user(),
spank_task_post_fork() and spank_task_exit() calls will be run inside the job's
namespace.
SlurmdPidFile [#OPT_SlurmdPidFile](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Fully qualified pathname of a file into which the slurmd daemon may write
its process id. This may be used for automated signal processing.
The first "%h" within the name is replaced with the hostname on which the
slurmd is running.
The first "%n" within the name is replaced with the Slurm node name on which the
slurmd is running.
The default value is "/var/run/slurmd.pid".
SlurmdPort [#OPT_SlurmdPort](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The port number that the Slurm compute node daemon, slurmd , listens
to for work. The default value is SLURMD_PORT as established at system
build time. If none is explicitly specified, its value will be 6818.
NOTE : Either slurmctld and slurmd daemons must not execute
on the same nodes or the values of SlurmctldPort and SlurmdPort
must be different.
NOTE : On Cray systems, Realm-Specific IP Addressing (RSIP) will
automatically try to interact with anything opened on ports 8192-60000.
Configure SlurmdPort to use a port outside of the configured SrunPortRange
and RSIP's port range.
SlurmdSpoolDir [#OPT_SlurmdSpoolDir](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Fully qualified pathname of a directory into which the slurmd
daemon's state information and batch job script information are written. This
must be a common pathname for all nodes, but should represent a directory which
is local to each node (reference a local file system). The default value
is "/var/spool/slurmd".
The first "%h" within the name is replaced with the hostname on which the
slurmd is running.
The first "%n" within the name is replaced with the Slurm node name on which the
slurmd is running.
SlurmdSyslogDebug [#OPT_SlurmdSyslogDebug](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The slurmd daemon will log events to the syslog file at the specified
level of detail. If not set, the slurmd daemon will log to syslog at
level fatal , unless there is no SlurmdLogFile and it is running
in the background, in which case it will log to syslog at the level specified
by SlurmdDebug (at fatal in the case that SlurmdDebug
is set to quiet ) or it is run in the foreground, when it will be set to
quiet.
quiet [#OPT_quiet_3](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Log nothing

debug4 [#OPT_debug4_3](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Log errors and verbose informational messages and even more debugging messages
debug5 [#OPT_debug5_3](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Log errors and verbose informational messages and even more debugging messages
NOTE : By default, Slurm's systemd service file starts the slurmd daemon in
the foreground with the --systemd option. This means that systemd will capture
stdout/stderr output and print that to syslog, independent of Slurm printing to
syslog directly. To prevent systemd from doing this, add "StandardOutput=null"
and "StandardError=null" to the respective service files or override files.
SlurmdTimeout [#OPT_SlurmdTimeout](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The interval, in seconds, that the Slurm controller waits for slurmd
to respond before configuring that node's state to DOWN.
A value of zero indicates the node will not be tested by slurmctld to
confirm the state of slurmd , the node will not be automatically set to
a DOWN state indicating a non-responsive slurmd , and some other tool
will take responsibility for monitoring the state of each compute node
and its slurmd daemon.
Slurm's hierarchical communication mechanism is used to ping the slurmd
daemons in order to minimize system noise and overhead.
The default value is 300 seconds.
The value may not exceed 65533 seconds.
SlurmdUser [#OPT_SlurmdUser](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The name of the user that the slurmd daemon executes as.
This user must exist on all nodes of the cluster for authentication
of communications between Slurm components.
The default value is "root", which should be kept in almost all cases so that
slurmd can run jobs as the user that submitted them.
SlurmSchedLogFile [#OPT_SlurmSchedLogFile](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Fully qualified pathname of the scheduling event logging file.
The syntax of this parameter is the same as for SlurmctldLogFile .
In order to configure scheduler logging, set both the SlurmSchedLogFile
and SlurmSchedLogLevel parameters.
SlurmSchedLogLevel [#OPT_SlurmSchedLogLevel](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The initial level of scheduling event logging, similar to the
SlurmctldDebug parameter used to control the initial level of
slurmctld logging.
Valid values for SlurmSchedLogLevel are "0" (scheduler logging
disabled) and "1" (scheduler logging enabled).
If this parameter is omitted, the value defaults to "0" (disabled).
In order to configure scheduler logging, set both the SlurmSchedLogFile
and SlurmSchedLogLevel parameters.
The scheduler logging level can be changed dynamically using scontrol .
SlurmUser [#OPT_SlurmUser](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The name of the user that the slurmctld daemon executes as.
For security purposes, a user other than "root" is recommended.
This user must exist on all nodes of the cluster for authentication
of communications between Slurm components.
The default value is "root".
SrunEpilog [#OPT_SrunEpilog](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Fully qualified pathname of an executable to be run by srun following
the completion of a job step. The command line arguments for the
executable will be the command and arguments of the job step. This
configuration parameter may be overridden by srun's --epilog
parameter. Note that while the other "Epilog" executables (e.g.,
TaskEpilog) are run by slurmd on the compute nodes where the tasks are
executed, the SrunEpilog runs on the node where the "srun" is
executing.
SrunPortRange [#OPT_SrunPortRange](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The srun creates a set of listening ports to communicate with the
controller, the slurmstepd and to handle the application I/O.
By default these ports are ephemeral meaning the port numbers are selected
by the kernel. Using this parameter allow sites to configure a range of ports
from which srun ports will be selected. This is useful if sites want to
allow only certain port range on their network.
NOTE : On Cray systems, Realm-Specific IP Addressing (RSIP) will
automatically try to interact with anything opened on ports 8192-60000.
Configure SrunPortRange to use a range of ports above those used by RSIP,
ideally 1000 or more ports, for example "SrunPortRange=60001-63000".
NOTE : SrunPortRange must be large enough to cover the expected
number of srun ports created. A single srun opens 4 listening ports plus 2
more for every 48 hosts beyond the first 48. Use of the --pty option
will result in an additional port being used.
Example:
```text
srun -N 1 will use 4 listening ports. srun --pty -N 1 will use 5 listening ports. srun -N 48 will use 4 listening ports. srun -N 50 will use 6 listening ports. srun -N 200 will use 12 listening ports.
```
SrunProlog [#OPT_SrunProlog](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Fully qualified pathname of an executable to be run by srun prior to
the launch of a job step. The command line arguments for the
executable will be the command and arguments of the job step. This
configuration parameter may be overridden by srun's --prolog
parameter. Note that while the other "Prolog" executables (e.g.,
TaskProlog) are run by slurmd on the compute nodes where the tasks are
executed, the SrunProlog runs on the node where the "srun" is
executing.
StateSaveLocation [#OPT_StateSaveLocation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Fully qualified pathname of a directory into which the Slurm controller,
slurmctld , saves its state (e.g. "/usr/local/slurm/checkpoint").
Slurm state will saved here to recover from system failures.
SlurmUser must be able to create files in this directory.
If you have a secondary SlurmctldHost configured, this location should be
readable and writable by both systems.
Since all running and pending job information is stored here, the use of
a reliable file system (e.g. RAID) is recommended.
The default value is "/var/spool".
If any slurm daemons terminate abnormally, their core files will also be written
into this directory.
SuspendExcNodes [#OPT_SuspendExcNodes](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specifies the nodes which are to not be placed in power save mode, even
if the node remains idle for an extended period of time.
Use Slurm's hostlist expression or NodeSets to identify nodes with an optional
":" separator and count of nodes to exclude from the preceding range.
For example "nid[10-20]:4" will prevent 4 powered up nodes in the set
"nid[10-20]" from being powered down.
Multiple sets of nodes can be specified with or without counts in a comma
separated list (e.g "nid[10-20]:4,nid[80-90]:2").
By default no nodes are excluded.
This value may be updated with scontrol.
See ReconfigFlags=KeepPowerSaveSettings for setting persistence.
SuspendExcParts [#OPT_SuspendExcParts](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specifies the partitions whose nodes are to not be placed in power save
mode, even if the node remains idle for an extended period of time.
Multiple partitions can be identified and separated by commas.
By default no nodes are excluded.
This value may be updated with scontrol.
See ReconfigFlags=KeepPowerSaveSettings for setting persistence.
SuspendExcStates [#OPT_SuspendExcStates](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specifies node states that are not to be powered down automatically.
Valid states include CLOUD, DOWN, DRAIN, DYNAMIC_FUTURE, DYNAMIC_NORM, FAIL,
INVALID_REG, MAINTENANCE, NOT_RESPONDING, PERFCTRS, PLANNED, and RESERVED.
By default, any of these states, if idle for SuspendTime , would be
powered down.
This value may be updated with scontrol.
See ReconfigFlags=KeepPowerSaveSettings for setting persistence.
SuspendProgram [#OPT_SuspendProgram](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) SuspendProgram is the program that will be executed when a node
remains idle for an extended period of time.
This program is expected to place the node into some power save mode.
This can be used to reduce the frequency and voltage of a node or
completely power the node off.
The program executes as SlurmUser .
The argument to the program will be the names of nodes to
be placed into power savings mode (using Slurm's hostlist
expression format).
By default, no program is run.
Programs will be killed if they run longer than the largest configured, global
or partition, ResumeTimeout or SuspendTimeout .
SuspendRate [#OPT_SuspendRate](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The rate at which nodes are placed into power save mode by SuspendProgram .
The value is number of nodes per minute and it can be used to prevent
a large drop in power consumption (e.g. after a large job completes).
A value of zero results in no limits being imposed.
The default value is 60 nodes per minute.
SuspendTime [#OPT_SuspendTime](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Nodes which remain idle or down for this number of seconds will be placed into
power save mode by SuspendProgram .
Setting SuspendTime to anything but INFINITE (or -1) will enable power
save mode. INFINITE is the default.
SuspendTimeout [#OPT_SuspendTimeout](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Maximum time permitted (in seconds) between when a node suspend request
is issued and when the node is shutdown.
At that time the node must be ready for a resume request to be issued
as needed for new work.
The default value is 30 seconds.
SwitchParameters [#OPT_SwitchParameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Optional parameters for the switch plugin.
On HPE Slingshot systems configured with SwitchType=switch/hpe_slingshot ,
the following parameters are supported
(separate multiple parameters with a comma):
vnis =< min >-< max >[#OPT_vnis](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Range of VNIs to allocate for jobs and applications.
The default value is 1024-65535.
destroy_retries =< retry attempts >[#OPT_destroy_retries](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Configure the number of times destroying CXI services is retried at the end of
the step. There is a one second pause between each retry.
The default value is 5.
tcs =< class1 >[:< class2 >]...[#OPT_tcs](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Set of traffic classes to configure for applications.
Supported traffic classes are DEDICATED_ACCESS, LOW_LATENCY, BULK_DATA, and
BEST_EFFORT. The traffic classes may also be specified as TC_DEDICATED_ACCESS,
TC_LOW_LATENCY, TC_BULK_DATA, and TC_BEST_EFFORT.
single_node_vni =< all | user | none >[#OPT_single_node_vni](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set to 'all', allocate a VNI for all job steps (by default, no VNI will be
allocated for single-node job steps).
If set to 'user', allocate a VNI for single-node job steps using the srun
--network=single_node_vni option or SLURM_NETWORK=single_node_vni
environment variable.
If set to 'none' (or if single_node_vni is not set), do not allocate any
VNI for single-node job steps.
For backwards compatibility, setting single_node_vni with no argument is
equivalent to 'all'.
job_vni =< all | user | none >[#OPT_job_vni](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set to 'all', allocate an additional VNI for jobs, shared among all job steps.
If set to 'user', allocate an additional VNI for any job using the srun
--network=job_vni option or SLURM_NETWORK=job_vni environment
variable.
If set to 'none' (or if job_vni is not set), do not allocate any
additional VNI for jobs. For backwards compatibility, setting job_vni with
no argument is equivalent to 'all'.
adjust_limits [#OPT_adjust_limits](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, slurmd will set an upper bound on network resource reservations
by taking the per-NIC maximum resource quantity and subtracting the
reserved or used values (whichever is higher) for any system network services;
this is the default.
no_adjust_limits [#OPT_no_adjust_limits](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, slurmd will calculate network resource reservations
based only upon the per-resource configuration default and number of tasks
in the application; it will not set an upper bound on those reservation
requests based on resource usage of already-existing system network services.
Setting this will mean more application launches could fail based
on network resource exhaustion, but if the application
absolutely needs a certain amount of resources to function, this option
will ensure that.
hwcoll_addrs_per_job [#OPT_hwcoll_addrs_per_job](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The number of Slingshot hardware collectives multicast addresses to allocate
per job. (That are larger than hwcoll_min_nodes nodes)
hwcoll_num_nodes [#OPT_hwcoll_num_nodes](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The minimum number of nodes for a job to be allocated Slingshot hardware
collectives. Because the hardware collective engine is not expected to offer a
meaningful performance boost for jobs spanning a small number of nodes.
fm_url [#OPT_fm_url](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, slurm will use the configured URL to interface with the fabric
manager to enable Slingshot hardware collectives.
Note enable_stepmgr needs to be set for hardware collectives to run.
fm_auth [#OPT_fm_auth](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) HPE fabric manager REST API authentication type
(BASIC or OAUTH, default OAUTH).
fm_authdir [#OPT_fm_authdir](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Directory containing authentication info files (default /etc/fmsim
for BASIC authentication, /etc/wlm-client-auth for OAUTH authentication).
fm_mtls_url [#OPT_fm_mtls_url](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) This sets an alternative URL to fm_url that slurm daemons will use to
interface with the fabric manager to enable Slingshot hardware collectives when
mTLS authentication is enabled. If this is not set, fm_url will be used
instead. To enable mTLS authentication see fm_mtls_ca , fm_mtls_cert ,
and fm_mtls_key .
Note : Setting fm_url and enable_stepmgr are required to enable
Slingshot hardware collectives.
fm_mtls_ca [#OPT_fm_mtls_ca](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Path to Certificate Authority (CA) bundle file or directory containing a file
signed by the fabric manager certificate. If set, the identity of the fabric
manager server will be verified if Slingshot hardware collectives are enabled.
See also fm_mtls_cert and fm_mtls_key .
Note : This option is not required to enable mTLS authentication with the
fabric manager. However, without it the client (slurmctld and stepmgr processes)
will not be able to verify the server identity.
fm_mtls_cert [#OPT_fm_mtls_cert](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Path to client public certificate. This is required to enable mTLS
authentication with the fabric manager when Slingshot hardware collectives are
enabled. See also fm_mtls_ca and fm_mtls_key .
fm_mtls_key [#OPT_fm_mtls_key](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Path to client private key. This is required to enable mTLS authentication to
the fabric manager when Slingshot hardware collectives are enabled.
See also fm_mtls_ca and fm_mtls_cert .
nic_distribution_count =< val >[#OPT_nic_distribution_count](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The default number of NICs users will evenly distribute their tasks over.
Users can override this value by using
--network=nic_distribution_count =< val > option or the

secure method of sharing memory. The default value is 2048.
By default, each job is allocated one IMEX channel that is accessible by the
batch, interactive, and normal job steps on all nodes within the job. If using
--network=unique-channel-per-segment on job submission and
topology/block is configured, then each segment will be allocated one
IMEX channel that is accessible by the batch, interactive, and normal job steps
on all nodes within that particular segment.
SwitchType [#OPT_SwitchType](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Identifies the type of switch or interconnect used for application
communications.
The default value is no special plugin requiring special processing for job
launch or termination (Ethernet, and InfiniBand).
All Slurm daemons, commands and running jobs must be restarted or reconfigured
for a change in SwitchType to take effect.
If running jobs exist at the time slurmctld is restarted with a new
value of SwitchType , records of all jobs in any state may be lost.
Acceptable values include:
switch/hpe_slingshot [#OPT_switch/hpe_slingshot](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) For HPE Slingshot systems.
switch/nvidia_imex [#OPT_switch/nvidia_imex](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) For allocating unique channels within an NVIDIA IMEX domain.
TaskEpilog [#OPT_TaskEpilog](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Fully qualified pathname of a program to be executed as the slurm job's user
after termination of each task. Will run inside of the job's container if
configured. Should not be used for policy enforcement.
See TaskProlog for execution order details.
TaskPlugin [#OPT_TaskPlugin](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Identifies the type of task launch plugin, typically used to provide
resource management within a node (e.g. pinning tasks to specific
processors). More than one task plugin can be specified in a comma-separated
list. The prefix of "task/" is optional. Unset by default.
Acceptable values include:
task/affinity [#OPT_task/affinity](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) binds processes to specified resources using sched_setaffinity().
This enables the --cpu-bind and/or --mem-bind srun options.
task/cgroup [#OPT_task/cgroup](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) enables process containment to specified resources using Cgroups cpuset
interface. This enables the --cpu-bind and/or --mem-bind srun options.
NOTE : see "man cgroup.conf" for configuration details.
NOTE : It is recommended to stack task/cgroup,task/affinity together
when configuring TaskPlugin, and setting ConstrainCores=yes in
cgroup.conf . This setup uses the task/affinity plugin for setting the
cpu mask for tasks and uses the task/cgroup plugin to fence tasks into the
allocated cpus.
TaskPluginParam [#OPT_TaskPluginParam](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Optional parameters for the task plugin.
Multiple options should be comma separated.
None , Sockets , Cores and Threads are mutually
exclusive and treated as a last possible source of --cpu-bind default. See also

Overrides automatic binding.
SlurmdSpecOverride [#OPT_SlurmdSpecOverride](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If slurmd is started in a cgroup which has cpuset or memory constraints, then
CpuSpecList and MemSpecLimit will be set and will override the configured
values. This will avoid scheduling resources from these constraints. In
cgroup/v1, slurmd and slurmstepd daemons will now not be able to use any
of these resources. While in normal behavior, cgroup/v1 constrains the
daemons to CpuSpecList and MemSpecLimit.
SlurmdOffSpec [#OPT_SlurmdOffSpec](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If specialized cores or CPUs are identified for the node (i.e. the
CoreSpecCount or CpuSpecList are configured for the node),
then Slurm daemons running on the compute node (i.e. slurmd and slurmstepd)
should run outside of those resources (i.e. specialized resources are
completely unavailable to Slurm daemons and jobs spawned by Slurm).
OOMKillStep [#OPT_OOMKillStep](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Set this parameter to kill the whole step in all the nodes in case an OOM event
is triggered in any task of the step.
This applies to entire allocations but does not apply to the external step.
It can be overwritten by the user.
NOTE : This parameter requires the task/cgroup plugin, Cgroups v2,
and a kernel newer than 4.19.
Verbose [#OPT_Verbose](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Verbosely report binding before tasks run by default.
Autobind [#OPT_Autobind](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Set a default binding in the event that "auto binding" doesn't find a match.
Set to Threads, Cores or Sockets (E.g. TaskPluginParam=autobind=threads).
TaskProlog [#OPT_TaskProlog](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Fully qualified pathname of a program to be executed as the slurm job's user
prior to initiation of each task. Will run inside of the job's container if
configured. Should not be used for policy enforcement.
Besides the normal environment variables, this has SLURM_TASK_PID
available to identify the process ID of the task being started.
Standard output from this program can be used to control the environment
variables and output for the user program.
export NAME=value [#OPT_export-NAME=value](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Will set environment variables for the task being spawned.
Everything after the equal sign to the end of the
line will be used as the value for the environment variable.
Exporting of functions is not currently supported.
print ... [#OPT_print-...](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Will cause that line (without the leading "print ")
to be printed to the job's standard output.
unset NAME [#OPT_unset-NAME](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Will clear environment variables for the task being spawned.

TLSType [#OPT_TLSType](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specify the TLS implementation that will be used. Unset by default.
Acceptable values at present:
tls/s2n [#OPT_tls/s2n](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Use the s2n TLS plugin. Requires additional configuration and causes significant
processing overhead, but allows all Slurm communication to be encrypted. Refer
to the TLS guide for more details: <[https://slurm.schedmd.com/tls.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/tls.html)>
TmpFS [#OPT_TmpFS](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Fully qualified pathname of the file system available to user jobs for

Dragonfly [#OPT_Dragonfly](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Optimize allocation for Dragonfly network.
Valid when TopologyPlugin=topology/tree.
RoutePart [#OPT_RoutePart](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Instead of using the plugin's default route calculation, use partition node
lists to route communications from the controller. Once on the compute node,
communications will be routed using the requested plugin's normal algorithm,
following TreeWidth if applicable. If a node is in multiple partitions,
the first partition seen will be used. The controller will communicate directly
with any nodes that aren't in a partition.
BlockAsNodeRank [#OPT_BlockAsNodeRank](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Assign the same node rank to all nodes under one base block.
This can be useful if the naming convention for the nodes does not match the
network topology.
Valid when topology/block is a cluster default topology.
SwitchAsNodeRank [#OPT_SwitchAsNodeRank](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Assign the same node rank to all nodes under one leaf switch.
This can be useful if the naming convention for the nodes does not match the
network topology.
Valid when topology/tree is a cluster default topology.
RouteTree [#OPT_RouteTree](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Use the switch hierarchy defined in a topology.conf file for routing
instead of just scheduling.
Valid when TopologyPlugin=topology/tree.
Incompatible with dynamic nodes.
TopoMaxSizeUnroll =#[#OPT_TopoMaxSizeUnroll](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Maximum number of individual job sizes automatically unrolled
from min-max nodes job specification.
Default: -1 (option disabled).
Valid when TopologyPlugin=topology/block.
TopoOptional [#OPT_TopoOptional](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Only optimize allocation for network topology if the job includes a switch
option. Since optimizing resource allocation for topology involves much higher
system overhead, this option can be used to impose the extra overhead only on
jobs which can take advantage of it. If most job allocations are not optimized
for network topology, they may fragment resources to the point that topology
optimization for other jobs will be difficult to achieve.
NOTE : Jobs may span across nodes without common parent switches with
this enabled.
TopologyPlugin [#OPT_TopologyPlugin](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Identifies the plugin to be used for determining the network topology
and optimizing job allocations to minimize network contention.
See NETWORK TOPOLOGY below for details.
Additional plugins may be provided in the future which gather topology
information directly from the network.
Acceptable values include:
topology/block [#OPT_topology/block](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) used for a block network topology, as described in the [topology.conf](https://slurm.schedmd.com/topology.conf.html) (5)
man page
topology/flat [#OPT_topology/flat](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) best-fit logic over one-dimensional topology. This is the default.
topology/tree [#OPT_topology/tree](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) used for a hierarchical network with the select/cons_tres plugin,
as described in the [topology.conf](https://slurm.schedmd.com/topology.conf.html) (5)
man page
NOTE : This option is ignored if topology.yaml exists.
TrackWCKey [#OPT_TrackWCKey](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Boolean yes or no. Used to set display and track of the Workload
Characterization Key. Must be set to track correct wckey usage.
NOTE : You must also set TrackWCKey in your slurmdbd.conf file to create
historical usage reports.
TreeWidth [#OPT_TreeWidth](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Slurmd daemons use a virtual tree network for communications.
TreeWidth specifies the width of the tree (i.e. the fanout).
The default value is 16, meaning each slurmd daemon can
communicate with up to 16 other slurmd daemons. This value balances offloading
slurmctld (max 16 threads running), time of communication, and node fault
tolerance (4368 nodes can be contacted with three message hops). The default
value will work well for most clusters however on bigger systems this value can
be increased to avoid long timeouts and retransmissions in case of unresponsive
nodes. The value may not exceed 65533.
UnkillableStepProgram [#OPT_UnkillableStepProgram](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If the processes in a job step are determined to be unkillable for a period
of time specified by the UnkillableStepTimeout variable, the program
specified by UnkillableStepProgram will be executed.
By default no program is run.
See section UNKILLABLE STEP PROGRAM SCRIPT for more information.
UnkillableStepTimeout [#OPT_UnkillableStepTimeout](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The length of time, in seconds, that Slurm will wait before deciding that
processes in a job step are unkillable (after they have been signaled with
SIGKILL) and execute UnkillableStepProgram .
The default timeout value is 60 seconds or five times the value of
MessageTimeout, whichever is greater.
If exceeded, the compute node will be drained to prevent future jobs from being
scheduled on the node.
NOTE : Ensure that UnkillableStepTimeout is at least 5 times larger than
MessageTimeout, otherwise it can lead to unexpected draining of nodes.
UrlParserType [#OPT_UrlParserType](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specify the url_parser implementation that will be used. Default is
url_parser/libhttp_parser .
Acceptable values at present:
url_parser/libhttp_parser [#OPT_url_parser/libhttp_parser](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Use the libhttp_parser based plugin.
UsePAM [#OPT_UsePAM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set to 1, PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux) will be enabled.
PAM is used to establish the upper bounds for resource limits. With PAM support
enabled, local system administrators can dynamically configure system resource
limits. Changing the upper bound of a resource limit will not alter the limits
of running jobs, only jobs started after a change has been made will pick up
the new limits.
The default value is 0 (not to enable PAM support).
Remember that PAM also needs to be configured to support Slurm as a service.
For sites using PAM's directory based configuration option, a configuration
file named slurm should be created. The module-type, control-flags, and
module-path names that should be included in the file are:
auth required pam_localuser.so
auth required pam_shells.so
account required pam_unix.so
account required pam_access.so
session required pam_unix.so
For sites configuring PAM with a general configuration file, the appropriate
lines (see above), where slurm is the service-name, should be added.
See <[https://slurm.schedmd.com/pam_slurm_adopt.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/pam_slurm_adopt.html)> for more details.
NOTE : UsePAM option has nothing to do with the
contribs/pam/pam_slurm and/or contribs/pam_slurm_adopt modules. So
these two modules can work independently of the value set for UsePAM.
VSizeFactor [#OPT_VSizeFactor](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Memory specifications in job requests apply to real memory size (also known
as resident set size). It is possible to enforce virtual memory limits for
both jobs and job steps by limiting their virtual memory to some percentage
of their real memory allocation. The VSizeFactor parameter specifies
the job's or job step's virtual memory limit as a percentage of its real
memory limit. For example, if a job's real memory limit is 500MB and
VSizeFactor is set to 101 then the job will be killed if its real memory
exceeds 500MB or its virtual memory exceeds 505MB (101 percent of the
real memory limit).
The default value is 0, which disables enforcement of virtual memory limits.
The value may not exceed 65533 percent.
NOTE : This parameter is dependent on OverMemoryKill being
configured in JobAcctGatherParams . It is also possible
to configure the TaskPlugin to use task/cgroup for memory
enforcement. VSizeFactor will not have an effect on memory enforcement
done through cgroups.
WaitTime [#OPT_WaitTime](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specifies how many seconds the srun command should by default wait after
the first task terminates before terminating all remaining tasks. The
"--wait" option on the srun command line overrides this value.
The default value is 0, which disables this feature.
May not exceed 65533 seconds.
X11Parameters [#OPT_X11Parameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) For use with Slurm's built-in X11 forwarding implementation.
home_xauthority [#OPT_home_xauthority](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set, xauth data on the compute node will be placed in ~/.Xauthority
rather than in a temporary file under TmpFS .
## NODE CONFIGURATION[#SECTION_NODE-CONFIGURATION](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html)
The configuration of nodes (or machines) to be managed by Slurm is
also specified in /etc/slurm.conf .
Changes in node configuration (e.g. adding nodes, changing their
processor count, etc.) require restarting or reconfiguring all slurmctld
and slurmd daemons.
All slurmd daemons must know each node in the system to forward
messages in support of hierarchical communications.
Only the NodeName must be supplied in the configuration file.
All other node configuration information is optional.
It is advisable to establish baseline node configurations,
especially if the cluster is heterogeneous.
Nodes which register to the system with less than the configured resources
(e.g. too little memory), will be placed in the "DOWN" state to
avoid scheduling jobs on them.
Establishing baseline configurations will also speed Slurm's
scheduling process by permitting it to compare job requirements
against these (relatively few) configuration parameters and
possibly avoid having to check job requirements
against every individual node's configuration.
The resources checked at node registration time are: CPUs,
RealMemory and TmpDisk.
Default values can be specified with a record in which
NodeName is "DEFAULT".
The default entry values will apply only to lines following it in the
configuration file and the default values can be reset multiple times
in the configuration file with multiple entries where "NodeName=DEFAULT".
Each line where NodeName is "DEFAULT" will replace or add to previous
default values and will not reinitialize the default values.
The "NodeName=" specification must be placed on every line
describing the configuration of nodes.
A single node name can not appear as a NodeName value in more than one line
(duplicate node name records will be ignored).
In fact, it is generally possible and desirable to define the
configurations of all nodes in only a few lines.
This convention permits significant optimization in the scheduling
of larger clusters.
In order to support the concept of jobs requiring consecutive nodes
on some architectures,
node specifications should be place in this file in consecutive order.
No single node name may be listed more than once in the configuration
file.
Use "DownNodes=" to record the state of nodes which are temporarily
in a DOWN, DRAIN or FAILING state without altering permanent
configuration information.
A job step's tasks are allocated to nodes in order the nodes appear
in the configuration file. There is presently no capability within
Slurm to arbitrarily order a job step's tasks.
Multiple node names may be comma separated (e.g. "alpha,beta,gamma")
and/or a simple node range expression may optionally be used to
specify numeric ranges of nodes to avoid building a configuration
file with large numbers of entries.
The node range expression can contain one or more pairs of square brackets
with a sequence of comma-separated numbers and/or ranges of numbers
separated by a "-" (e.g., "linux[0-64,128]", "lx[15,18,32-33]", or
"rack[0-63]_blade[0-41]"). Note that the numeric ranges can include one or
more leading zeros to indicate the numeric portion has a fixed number of digits
(e.g. "linux[0000-1023]").
The node configuration specified the following information:
NodeName [#OPT_NodeName](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Name that Slurm uses to refer to a node.
Typically this would be the string that "/bin/hostname -s" returns.
It may also be the fully qualified domain name as returned by "/bin/hostname -f"
(e.g. "foo1.bar.com"), or any valid domain name associated with the host
through the host database (/etc/hosts) or DNS, depending on the resolver
settings. Note that if the short form of the hostname is not used, it
may prevent use of hostlist expressions (the numeric portion in brackets
must be at the end of the string).
It may also be an arbitrary string if NodeHostname is specified.
If the NodeName is "DEFAULT", the values specified
with that record will apply to subsequent node specifications
unless explicitly set to other values in that node record or
replaced with a different set of default values.
Each line where NodeName is "DEFAULT" will replace or add to previous
default values and not reinitialize the default values.
For architectures in which the node order is significant,
nodes will be considered consecutive in the order defined.
For example, if the configuration for "NodeName=charlie" immediately
follows the configuration for "NodeName=baker" they will be
considered adjacent in the computer.
NOTE : If the NodeName is "ALL" the process parsing the configuration
will exit immediately as it is an internally reserved word.
NodeHostname [#OPT_NodeHostname](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Typically this would be the string that "/bin/hostname -s" returns.
It may also be the fully qualified domain name as returned by "/bin/hostname -f"
(e.g. "foo1.bar.com"), or any valid domain name associated with the host
through the host database (/etc/hosts) or DNS, depending on the resolver
settings. Note that if the short form of the hostname is not used, it
may prevent use of hostlist expressions (the numeric portion in brackets
must be at the end of the string).
A node range expression can be used to specify a set of nodes.
If an expression is used, the number of nodes identified by
NodeHostname on a line in the configuration file must
be identical to the number of nodes identified by NodeName .
By default, the NodeHostname will be identical in value to
NodeName .
NodeAddr [#OPT_NodeAddr](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Name that a node should be referred to in establishing
a communications path.
This name will be used as an
argument to the getaddrinfo() function for identification.
If a node range expression is used to designate multiple nodes,
they must exactly match the entries in the NodeName
(e.g. "NodeName=lx[0-7] NodeAddr=elx[0-7]").
NodeAddr may also contain IP addresses.
By default, the NodeAddr will be identical in value to
NodeHostname .
BcastAddr [#OPT_BcastAddr](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Alternate network path to be used for sbcast network traffic to a given node.
This name will be used as an argument to the getaddrinfo() function.
If a node range expression is used to designate multiple nodes,
they must exactly match the entries in the NodeName
(e.g. "NodeName=lx[0-7] BcastAddr=elx[0-7]").
BcastAddr may also contain IP addresses.
By default, the BcastAddr is unset, and sbcast traffic will be routed
to the NodeAddr for a given node.
Note: cannot be used with CommunicationParameters=NoInAddrAny.
Boards [#OPT_Boards](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Number of Baseboards in nodes with a baseboard controller.
Note that when Boards is specified, SocketsPerBoard,
CoresPerSocket, and ThreadsPerCore should be specified.
The default value is 1.
CoreSpecCount [#OPT_CoreSpecCount](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Number of cores reserved for system use.
Depending upon the TaskPluginParam option of SlurmdOffSpec ,
the Slurm daemon slurmd may either be confined to these
resources (the default) or prevented from using these resources.
If cgroup/v1 is used, the same applies to the slurmstepd processes.
Isolation of slurmd from user jobs may improve application performance.
A job can use these cores if AllowSpecResourcesUsage=yes and the user
explicitly requests less than the configured CoreSpecCount.
If this option and CpuSpecList are both designated for a
node, an error is generated. For information on the algorithm used by Slurm
to select the cores refer to the core specialization documentation
( [https://slurm.schedmd.com/core_spec.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/core_spec.html) ).
CoresPerSocket [#OPT_CoresPerSocket](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Number of cores in a single physical processor socket (e.g. "2").
The CoresPerSocket value describes physical cores, not the
logical number of processors per socket.
NOTE : If you have multi-core processors, you will likely
need to specify this parameter in order to optimize scheduling.
The default value is 1.
CpuBind [#OPT_CpuBind](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If a job step request does not specify an option to control how tasks are bound
to allocated CPUs (by using --cpu-bind) and all nodes allocated to the job
have the same CpuBind option, the node CpuBind option will control
how tasks are bound to allocated resources. Partition definitions are used next
if the node definition(s) can't be used, followed by TaskPluginParam as a
last resort, with the default being no binding. Supported values for
CpuBind are none , socket , ldom (NUMA), core and
thread .
CPUs [#OPT_CPUs](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Number of logical processors on the node (e.g. "2").
It can be set to the total
number of sockets(supported only by select/linear), cores or threads.
This can be useful when you want to schedule only the cores on a hyper-threaded
node. If CPUs is omitted, its default will be set equal to the product of
Boards , Sockets , CoresPerSocket , and ThreadsPerCore .
CpuSpecList [#OPT_CpuSpecList](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) A comma-delimited list of Slurm abstract CPU IDs reserved for system use.
The list will be expanded to include all other CPUs, if any, on the same cores.
Depending upon the TaskPluginParam option of SlurmdOffSpec ,
the Slurm daemon slurmd may either be confined to these
resources (the default) or prevented from using these resources.
If cgroup/v1 is used, the same applies to the slurmstepd processes.
Isolation of slurmd from user jobs may improve application performance.
A job can use these cores if AllowSpecResourcesUsage=yes and the user
explicitly requests less than the number of CPUs in this list.
If this option and CoreSpecCount are both designated for a node,
an error is generated.
This option has no effect unless cgroup job confinement is also configured
(i.e. the task/cgroup TaskPlugin is enabled and
ConstrainCores=yes is set in cgroup.conf).
Features [#OPT_Features](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) A comma-delimited list of arbitrary strings indicative of some
characteristic associated with the node.
There is no value or count associated with a feature at this time, a node
either has a feature or it does not.
A desired feature may contain a numeric component indicating,
for example, processor speed but this numeric component will be considered to
be part of the feature string. Features are intended to be used to filter nodes
eligible to run jobs via the --constraint argument.
By default a node has no features.
Also see Gres for being able to have more control such as types and
count. Using features is faster than scheduling against GRES but is limited to
Boolean operations.
NOTE : The hostlist function feature{myfeature} expands to all nodes
with the specified feature. This may be used in place of or alongside regular
hostlist expressions in commands or configuration files that interact with the
slurmctld.
For example: scontrol update node=feature{myfeature} state=resume or
PartitionName=p1 Nodes=feature{myfeature} .
Gres [#OPT_Gres_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) A comma-delimited list of generic resources specifications for a node.
The format is: "<name>[:<type>][:no_consume]:<number>[K|M|G]".
The first field is the resource name, which matches the GresType configuration
parameter name.
The optional type field might be used to identify a model of that generic
resource.
It is forbidden to specify both an untyped GRES and a typed GRES with the same
<name>.
The optional no_consume field allows you to specify that a
generic resource does not have a finite number of that resource that gets
consumed as it is requested. The no_consume field is a GRES specific setting
and applies to the GRES, regardless of the type specified.
It should not be used with GRES that has a dedicated plugin, if you're looking
for a way to overcommit GPUs to multiple processes at the time you may be
interested in using "shard" GRES instead.
The final field must specify a generic resources count.
A suffix of "K", "M", "G", "T" or "P" may be used to multiply the number by
1024, 1048576, 1073741824, etc. respectively.
(e.g."Gres=gpu:tesla:1,gpu:kepler:1,bandwidth:lustre:no_consume:4G").
By default a node has no generic resources and its maximum count is
that of an unsigned 64bit integer.
Also see Features for Boolean flags to filter nodes using job constraints.
MemSpecLimit [#OPT_MemSpecLimit](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Amount of RealMemory , in megabytes, reserved for system use and not
available for user allocations. Must be less than the amount defined for
RealMemory .
If the task/cgroup plugin is configured and that plugin constrains memory
allocations (i.e. the task/cgroup TaskPlugin is enabled and
ConstrainRAMSpace=yes is set in cgroup.conf), then the slurmd will be
allocated the specified memory limit. If cgroup/v1 is used the slurmstepd will
also be allocated the specified memory limit. If cgroup/v2 is used, the
slurmstepd's consumption is completely dependent on the topology of the job.
Note that having the Memory set in SelectTypeParameters as any of the
options that has it as a consumable resource is needed for this option to work.
The daemons will not be killed if they exhaust the memory allocation
(i.e. the Out-Of-Memory Killer is disabled for the daemon's memory cgroup).
If the task/cgroup plugin is not configured, the specified memory will only be
unavailable for user allocations.
Parameters [#OPT_Parameters](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Allows for node-specific additions to the global SlurmdParameters .
Options are appended, and cannot override global options.
Port [#OPT_Port](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The port number that the Slurm compute node daemon, slurmd , listens
to for work on this particular node. By default there is a single port number
for all slurmd daemons on all compute nodes as defined by the
SlurmdPort configuration parameter. Use of this option is not generally
recommended except for development or testing purposes. If multiple
slurmd daemons execute on a node this can specify a range of ports.
NOTE : On Cray systems, Realm-Specific IP Addressing (RSIP) will
automatically try to interact with anything opened on ports 8192-60000.
Configure Port to use a port outside of the configured SrunPortRange and
RSIP's port range.
Procs [#OPT_Procs](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) See CPUs .
RealMemory [#OPT_RealMemory](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Size of real memory on the node in megabytes (e.g. "2048").
The default value is 1. Lowering RealMemory with the goal of setting
aside some amount for the OS and not available for job allocations
will not work as intended if Memory is not set as a consumable
resource in SelectTypeParameters . So one of the *_Memory
options need to be enabled for that goal to be accomplished.
Also see MemSpecLimit .
Reason [#OPT_Reason](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Identifies the reason for a node being in state "DOWN", "DRAINED"
"DRAINING", "FAIL" or "FAILING".
Use quotes to enclose a reason having more than one word.
RestrictedCoresPerGPU [#OPT_RestrictedCoresPerGPU](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Number of cores per GPU restricted for only GPU use. If a job does not request a
GPU it will not have access to these cores. The node's GPUs must either be
autodetected or have valid cores configured in [gres.conf](https://slurm.schedmd.com/gres.conf.html) (5).
NOTE : Configuring multiple GPU types on overlapping sockets can result in
erroneous GPU type and restricted core pairings in allocations requesting gpus
without specifying a type.
NOTE : Shared gpu gres (shards or mps) will have access to these cores, but
there is no guarantee that reserved cores are used in proportion to the shared
gres allocation.
Sockets [#OPT_Sockets_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Number of physical processor sockets/chips on the node (e.g. "2").
If Sockets is omitted, it will be inferred from
CPUs , CoresPerSocket , and ThreadsPerCore .
NOTE : If you have multi-core processors, you will likely
need to specify these parameters.
Sockets and SocketsPerBoard are mutually exclusive.
If Sockets is specified when Boards is also used,
Sockets is interpreted as SocketsPerBoard rather than total sockets.
The default value is 1.
SocketsPerBoard [#OPT_SocketsPerBoard](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Number of physical processor sockets/chips on a baseboard.
Sockets and SocketsPerBoard are mutually exclusive.
The default value is 1.
State [#OPT_State](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) State of the node with respect to the initiation of user jobs.
Acceptable values are CLOUD , DOWN , DRAIN , FAIL ,
FAILING , FUTURE and UNKNOWN .
Node states of BUSY and IDLE should not be specified in the node
configuration, but set the node state to UNKNOWN instead.
Setting the node state to UNKNOWN will result in the node state being
set to BUSY , IDLE or other appropriate state based upon recovered
system state information.
The default value is UNKNOWN .
Also see the DownNodes parameter below.
CLOUD [#OPT_CLOUD](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Indicates the node exists in the cloud.
Its initial state will be treated as powered down.
The node will be available for use after its state is recovered from Slurm's
state save file or the slurmd daemon starts on the compute node.
DOWN [#OPT_DOWN](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Indicates the node failed and is unavailable to be allocated work.
DRAIN [#OPT_DRAIN](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Indicates the node is unavailable to be allocated work.
FAIL [#OPT_FAIL](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Indicates the node is expected to fail soon, has
no jobs allocated to it, and will not be allocated
to any new jobs.
FAILING [#OPT_FAILING](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Indicates the node is expected to fail soon, has
one or more jobs allocated to it, but will not be allocated
to any new jobs.
FUTURE [#OPT_FUTURE](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Indicates the node is defined for future use and need not
exist when the Slurm daemons are started. These nodes can be made available
for use simply by updating the node state using the scontrol command rather
than restarting the slurmctld daemon. After these nodes are made available,
change their State in the slurm.conf file. Until these nodes are made
available, they will not be seen using any Slurm commands or nor will
any attempt be made to contact them. FUTURE nodes retain non-FUTURE state on
restart. Use scontrol to put node back into FUTURE state.
Dynamic Future Nodes [#OPT_Dynamic-Future-Nodes](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) A slurmd started with -F[<feature>] will be associated with a FUTURE
node that matches the same configuration (sockets, cores, threads) as reported
by slurmd -C. The node's NodeAddr and NodeHostname will automatically be
retrieved from the slurmd and will be cleared when set back to the FUTURE
state.
UNKNOWN [#OPT_UNKNOWN](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Indicates the node's state is undefined but will be established
(set to BUSY or IDLE ) when the slurmd daemon on that
node registers. UNKNOWN is the default state.
ThreadsPerCore [#OPT_ThreadsPerCore](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Number of logical threads in a single physical core (e.g. "2").
Note that the Slurm can allocate resources to jobs down to the
resolution of a core. If your system is configured with more than
one thread per core, execution of a different job on each thread
is not supported unless you configure SelectTypeParameters=CR_CPU
plus CPUs ; do not configure Sockets , CoresPerSocket or
ThreadsPerCore .
A job can execute a one task per thread from within one job step or
execute a distinct job step on each of the threads.
Note also if you are running with more than 1 thread per core and running
the select/cons_tres plugin then you will want to set
the SelectTypeParameters
variable to something other than CR_CPU to avoid unexpected results.
The default value is 1.
TmpDisk [#OPT_TmpDisk](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Total size of temporary disk storage in TmpFS in megabytes
(e.g. "16384"). TmpFS (for "Temporary File System")
identifies the location which jobs should use for temporary storage.
Note this does not indicate the amount of free
space available to the user on the node, only the total file
system size. The system administration should ensure this file
system is purged as needed so that user jobs have access to
most of this space.
The Prolog and/or Epilog programs (specified in the configuration file)
might be used to ensure the file system is kept clean.
The default value is 0.
Topology [#OPT_Topology](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Comma-separated list of pairs in the format
<topology_name> : <topology_unit> .
Where < topology_unit > is the block name or the name of a leaf switch.
Intermediate switch names -- ':' delimited -- can be provided and will be
created if needed (e.g. Topology=topo-tree:sw_root:s1:s2).
This setting overwrites the node topology affiliation configuration specified
in [topology.conf](https://slurm.schedmd.com/topology.conf.html) (5) and [topology.yaml](https://slurm.schedmd.com/topology.yaml.html) (5).
Weight [#OPT_Weight](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The priority of the node for scheduling purposes.
All things being equal, jobs will be allocated the nodes with
the lowest weight which satisfies their requirements.
For example, a heterogeneous collection of nodes might
be placed into a single partition for greater system
utilization, responsiveness and capability. It would be
preferable to allocate smaller memory nodes rather than larger
memory nodes if either will satisfy a job's requirements.
The units of weight are arbitrary, but larger weights
should be assigned to nodes with more processors, memory,
disk space, higher processor speed, etc.
Note that if a job allocation request can not be satisfied
using the nodes with the lowest weight, the set of nodes
with the next lowest weight is added to the set of nodes
under consideration for use (repeat as needed for higher
weight values). If you absolutely want to minimize the number
of higher weight nodes allocated to a job (at a cost of higher
scheduling overhead), give each node a distinct Weight
value and they will be added to the pool of nodes being
considered for scheduling individually.
The default value is 1.
NOTE : Node weights are first considered among currently available
nodes. For example, POWERED_DOWN and POWERING_UP nodes with lower weights will
not be evaluated before a powered up IDLE node.
## DOWN NODE CONFIGURATION[#SECTION_DOWN-NODE-CONFIGURATION](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html)
The DownNodes= parameter permits you to mark certain nodes as in a
DOWN , DRAIN , FAIL , FAILING or FUTURE state
without altering the permanent configuration information listed under a
NodeName= specification.
DownNodes [#OPT_DownNodes](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Any node name, or list of node names, from the NodeName= specifications.
Reason [#OPT_Reason_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Identifies the reason for a node being in state DOWN , DRAIN ,
FAIL , FAILING or FUTURE .
Use quotes to enclose a reason having more than one word.
State [#OPT_State_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) State of the node with respect to the initiation of user jobs.
Acceptable values are DOWN , DRAIN , FAIL , FAILING
and FUTURE .
For more information about these states see the descriptions under State
in the NodeName= section above.
The default value is DOWN .
## NODESET CONFIGURATION[#SECTION_NODESET-CONFIGURATION](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html)
The nodeset configuration allows you to define a name for a specific set of
nodes which can be used to simplify the partition configuration section,
especially for heterogeneous or condo-style systems. Each nodeset may be defined
by an explicit list of nodes, and/or by filtering the nodes by a particular
configured feature. If both Feature= and Nodes= are used the
nodeset shall be the union of the two subsets.
Note that the nodesets are only used to simplify the partition definitions
at present, and are not usable outside of the partition configuration.
Feature [#OPT_Feature](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) All nodes with this feature will be included as part of this nodeset. Only a
single feature is allowed.
Nodes [#OPT_Nodes](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) List of nodes in this set.
NodeSet [#OPT_NodeSet](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Unique name for a set of nodes. Must not overlap with any NodeName definitions.
## PARTITION CONFIGURATION[#SECTION_PARTITION-CONFIGURATION](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html)
The partition configuration permits you to establish different job
limits or access controls for various groups (or partitions) of nodes.
Nodes may be in more than one partition, making partitions serve
as general purpose queues.
For example one may put the same set of nodes into two different
partitions, each with different constraints (time limit, job sizes,
groups allowed to use the partition, etc.).
Jobs are allocated resources within a single partition.
Default values can be specified with a record in which
PartitionName is "DEFAULT".
The default entry values will apply only to lines following it in the
configuration file and the default values can be reset multiple times
in the configuration file with multiple entries where "PartitionName=DEFAULT".
The "PartitionName=" specification must be placed on every line
describing the configuration of partitions.
Each line where PartitionName is "DEFAULT" will replace or add to previous
default values and not reinitialize the default values.
A single partition name can not appear as a PartitionName value in more than
one line (duplicate partition name records will be ignored).
If a partition that is in use is deleted from the configuration and slurm
is restarted or reconfigured (scontrol reconfigure), jobs using the partition
are canceled.
NOTE : Put all parameters for each partition on a single line.
Each line of partition configuration information should
represent a different partition.
The partition configuration file contains the following information:
AllocNodes [#OPT_AllocNodes](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Comma-separated list of nodes from which users can submit jobs in the
partition.
Node names may be specified using the node range expression syntax
described above.
The default value is "ALL".
AllowAccounts [#OPT_AllowAccounts](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Comma-separated list of accounts which may execute jobs in the partition.
The default value is "ALL". This list is hierarchical, meaning subaccounts
are included automatically.
NOTE : If AllowAccounts is used then DenyAccounts will not be enforced.
Also refer to DenyAccounts.
AllowGroups [#OPT_AllowGroups](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Comma-separated list of group names which may execute jobs in this
partition.
A user will be permitted to submit a job to this partition if
AllowGroups has at least one group associated with the user.
Jobs executed as user root or as user SlurmUser will be allowed to
use any partition, regardless of the value of AllowGroups. In addition, a Slurm
Admin or Operator will be able to view any partition, regardless of the value
of AllowGroups.
If user root attempts to execute a job as another user (e.g. using
srun's --uid option), then the job will be subject to AllowGroups as if it
were submitted by that user.
By default, AllowGroups is unset, meaning all groups are allowed to use this
partition. The special value 'ALL' is equivalent to this.
Users who are not members of the specified group will not see information
about this partition by default. However, this should not be treated as a
security mechanism, since job information will be returned if a user requests
details about the partition or a specific job. See the PrivateData
parameter to restrict access to job information.
NOTE : For performance reasons, Slurm maintains a list of user IDs
allowed to use each partition and this is checked at job submission time.
This list of user IDs is updated when the slurmctld daemon is restarted,
reconfigured (e.g. "scontrol reconfig") or the partition's AllowGroups
value is reset, even if is value is unchanged
(e.g. "scontrol update PartitionName=name AllowGroups=group").
For a user's access to a partition to change, both his group membership must
change and Slurm's internal user ID list must change using one of the methods
described above.
AllowQos [#OPT_AllowQos](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Comma-separated list of Qos which may execute jobs in the partition.
Jobs executed as user root can use any partition without regard to
the value of AllowQos.
The default value is "ALL".
NOTE : If AllowQos is used then DenyQos will not be enforced.
Also refer to DenyQos.
Alternate [#OPT_Alternate](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Partition name of alternate partition to be used if the state of this partition
is "DRAIN" or "INACTIVE."
CpuBind [#OPT_CpuBind_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If a job step request does not specify an option to control how tasks are bound
to allocated CPUs (by using --cpu-bind) and all nodes allocated to the job
do not have the same CpuBind option for the node, then the partition's
CpuBind option will control how tasks are bound to allocated resources.
The TaskPluginParam will be used as a last resort, with the default being
no binding. Supported values for CpuBind are none , socket ,
ldom (NUMA), core and thread .
Default [#OPT_Default](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If this keyword is set, jobs submitted without a partition
specification will utilize this partition.
Possible values are "YES" and "NO".
The default value is "NO".
DefaultTime [#OPT_DefaultTime](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Run time limit used for jobs that don't specify a value. If not set, the
default will be set to an applicable time limit, which may be from the
partition (MaxTime) or from a QOS or association (MaxWall or GrpWall).
Regardless, MaxTime will still be enforced.
Format is the same as for MaxTime.
DefCpuPerGPU [#OPT_DefCpuPerGPU_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Default count of CPUs allocated per allocated GPU. This value is used only if
the job didn't specify --cpus-per-task and --cpus-per-gpu.
DefMemPerCPU [#OPT_DefMemPerCPU_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Default real memory size available per allocated CPU in megabytes.
Used to avoid over-subscribing memory and causing paging.
DefMemPerCPU would generally be used if individual processors
are allocated to jobs ( SelectType=select/cons_tres ).
If not set, the DefMemPerCPU value for the entire cluster will be used.
Also see DefMemPerGPU , DefMemPerNode and MaxMemPerCPU .
DefMemPerCPU , DefMemPerGPU and DefMemPerNode are mutually
exclusive.
DefMemPerGPU [#OPT_DefMemPerGPU_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Default real memory size available per allocated GPU in megabytes.
Please note a best effort attempt is made to predict which GPUs on the system
will be used, but this could change between job submission and start time,
causing MaxMemPerNode to potentially not work as expected for
heterogeneous jobs.
Also see DefMemPerCPU , DefMemPerNode and MaxMemPerCPU .
DefMemPerCPU , DefMemPerGPU and DefMemPerNode are mutually
exclusive.
DefMemPerNode [#OPT_DefMemPerNode_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Default real memory size available per allocated node in megabytes.
Used to avoid over-subscribing memory and causing paging.
DefMemPerNode would generally be used if whole nodes
are allocated to jobs ( SelectType=select/linear ) and
resources are over-subscribed ( OverSubscribe=yes or
OverSubscribe=force ).
If not set, the DefMemPerNode value for the entire cluster will be used.
Also see DefMemPerCPU , DefMemPerGPU and MaxMemPerCPU .
DefMemPerCPU , DefMemPerGPU and DefMemPerNode are mutually
exclusive.
DenyAccounts [#OPT_DenyAccounts](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Comma-separated list of accounts which may not execute jobs in the partition.
By default, no accounts are denied access. This list is hierarchical,
meaning subaccounts are included automatically.
NOTE : If AllowAccounts is used then DenyAccounts will not be enforced.
Also refer to AllowAccounts.
DenyQos [#OPT_DenyQos](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Comma-separated list of Qos which may not execute jobs in the partition.
By default, no QOS are denied access
NOTE : If AllowQos is used then DenyQos will not be enforced.
Also refer AllowQos.
DisableRootJobs [#OPT_DisableRootJobs_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set to "YES" then user root will be prevented from running any jobs
on this partition.
The default value will be the value of DisableRootJobs set
outside of a partition specification (which is "NO", allowing user
root to execute jobs).
ExclusiveTopo [#OPT_ExclusiveTopo](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set to "YES," then only one job may be run on a single topology segment.
This capability is also available on a per-job basis by using the
--exclusive=topo option.
ExclusiveUser [#OPT_ExclusiveUser](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set to "YES" then nodes will be exclusively allocated to users.
Multiple jobs may be run for the same user, but only one user can be active
at a time.
This capability is also available on a per-job basis by using the
--exclusive=user option.
GraceTime [#OPT_GraceTime](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specifies, in units of seconds, the preemption grace time
to be extended to a job which has been selected for preemption.
This parameter only takes effect when PreemptType=partition_prio .
The default value is zero, no preemption grace time is allowed on
this partition.
Once a job has been selected for preemption, its end time is set to the current
time plus GraceTime. The job's tasks are immediately sent SIGCONT and SIGTERM
signals in order to provide notification of its imminent termination.
This is followed by the SIGCONT, SIGTERM and SIGKILL signal sequence upon
reaching its new end time. This second set of signals is sent to both the
tasks and the containing batch script, if applicable.
See also the global KillWait configuration parameter.
NOTE : This parameter does not apply to PreemptMode=SUSPEND .
For setting the preemption grace time when using PreemptMode=SUSPEND ,
see PreemptParameters=suspend_grace_time .
Hidden [#OPT_Hidden](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specifies if the partition and its jobs are to be hidden by default.
Hidden partitions will by default not be reported by the Slurm APIs or commands.
Possible values are "YES" and "NO".
The default value is "NO".
Note that partitions that a user lacks access to by virtue of the
AllowGroups parameter will also be hidden by default.
LLN [#OPT_LLN](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Schedule resources to jobs on the least loaded nodes (based upon the number
of idle CPUs). This is generally only recommended for an environment with
serial jobs as idle resources will tend to be highly fragmented, resulting
in parallel jobs being distributed across many nodes.
Note that node Weight takes precedence over how many idle resources are
on each node.
Also see the SelectTypeParameters configuration parameter CR_LLN to
use the least loaded nodes in every partition.
MaxCPUsPerNode [#OPT_MaxCPUsPerNode](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Maximum number of CPUs on any node available to all jobs from this partition.
This can be especially useful to schedule GPUs. For example a node can be
associated with two Slurm partitions (e.g. "cpu" and "gpu") and the
partition/queue "cpu" could be limited to only a subset of the node's CPUs,
ensuring that one or more CPUs would be available to jobs in the "gpu"
partition/queue.
Also see MaxCPUsPerSocket .
MaxCPUsPerSocket [#OPT_MaxCPUsPerSocket](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Maximum number of CPUs on any node available on the all jobs from this
partition. This can be especially useful to schedule GPUs.
Also see MaxCPUsPerNode .
MaxMemPerCPU [#OPT_MaxMemPerCPU_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Maximum real memory size available per allocated CPU in megabytes.
Used to avoid over-subscribing memory and causing paging.
MaxMemPerCPU would generally be used if individual processors
are allocated to jobs ( SelectType=select/cons_tres ).
If not set, the MaxMemPerCPU value for the entire cluster will be used.
Also see DefMemPerCPU and MaxMemPerNode .
MaxMemPerCPU and MaxMemPerNode are mutually exclusive.
MaxMemPerNode [#OPT_MaxMemPerNode_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Maximum real memory size available per allocated node in a job allocation in
megabytes. Used to avoid over-subscribing memory and causing paging.
MaxMemPerNode would generally be used if whole nodes
are allocated to jobs ( SelectType=select/linear ) and
resources are over-subscribed ( OverSubscribe=yes or
OverSubscribe=force ).
If not set, the MaxMemPerNode value for the entire cluster will be used.
Also see DefMemPerNode and MaxMemPerCPU .
MaxMemPerCPU and MaxMemPerNode are mutually exclusive.
MaxNodes [#OPT_MaxNodes](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Maximum count of nodes which may be allocated to any single job.
The default value is "UNLIMITED", which is represented internally as -1.
MaxTime [#OPT_MaxTime](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Maximum run time limit for jobs.
Format is minutes, minutes:seconds, hours:minutes:seconds,
days-hours, days-hours:minutes, days-hours:minutes:seconds or
"UNLIMITED".
Time resolution is one minute and second values are rounded up to
the next minute.
The job TimeLimit may be updated by root, SlurmUser or an Operator to a
value higher than the configured MaxTime after job submission.
MinNodes [#OPT_MinNodes](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Minimum count of nodes which may be allocated to any single job.
The default value is 0.
Nodes [#OPT_Nodes_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Comma-separated list of nodes or nodesets which are associated with this
partition.
Node names may be specified using the node range expression syntax
described above. A blank list of nodes
(i.e. Nodes="") can be used if one wants a partition to exist,
but have no resources (possibly on a temporary basis).
A value of "ALL" is mapped to all nodes configured in the cluster.
OverSubscribe [#OPT_OverSubscribe](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Controls the ability of the partition to execute more than one job at a
time on each resource (node, socket or core depending upon the value
of SelectTypeParameters ).
If resources are to be over-subscribed, avoiding memory over-subscription
is very important.
SelectTypeParameters should be configured to treat
memory as a consumable resource and the --mem option
should be used for job allocations.
Sharing of resources is typically useful only when using gang scheduling
( PreemptMode=suspend,gang ).
Possible values for OverSubscribe are "EXCLUSIVE", "FORCE", "YES", and "NO".
Note that a value of "YES" or "FORCE" can negatively impact performance
for systems with many thousands of running jobs.
The default value is "NO".
For more information see the following web pages:
[cons_tres](https://slurm.schedmd.com/cons_tres.html)
[cons_tres_share](https://slurm.schedmd.com/cons_tres_share.html)
[gang_scheduling](https://slurm.schedmd.com/gang_scheduling.html)
[preempt](https://slurm.schedmd.com/preempt.html)
EXCLUSIVE [#OPT_EXCLUSIVE](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Allocates entire nodes to jobs even with SelectType=select/cons_tres
configured.
Jobs that run in partitions with OverSubscribe=EXCLUSIVE will have
exclusive access to all allocated nodes.
These jobs are allocated all CPUs and GRES on the nodes, but they are only
allocated as much memory as they ask for. This is by design to support gang
scheduling, because suspended jobs still reside in memory. To request all the
memory on a node, use --mem=0 at submit time.
FORCE [#OPT_FORCE](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Makes all resources (except GRES) in the partition available for
oversubscription without any means for users to disable it.
May be followed with a colon and maximum number of jobs in
running or suspended state.
For example OverSubscribe=FORCE:4 enables each node, socket or
core to oversubscribe each resource four ways.
Recommended only for systems using PreemptMode=suspend,gang .
NOTE : OverSubscribe=FORCE:1 is a special case that is not exactly
equivalent to OverSubscribe=NO . OverSubscribe=FORCE:1 disables
the regular oversubscription of resources in the same partition but it will
still allow oversubscription due to preemption or on overlapping partitions
with the same PriorityTier. Setting OverSubscribe=NO
will prevent oversubscription from happening in all cases.
NOTE : If using PreemptType=preempt/qos you can specify a value for
FORCE that is greater than 1. For example, OverSubscribe=FORCE:2
will permit two jobs per resource normally, but a third job can be started
only if done so through preemption based upon QOS.
NOTE : If OverSubscribe is configured to FORCE or YES
in your slurm.conf and the system is not configured to use preemption
( PreemptMode=OFF ) accounting can easily grow to values greater than
the actual utilization. It may be common on such systems to get error messages
in the slurmdbd log stating: "We have more allocated time than is possible."
YES [#OPT_YES](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Makes all resources (except GRES) in the partition available for sharing upon
request by the job.
Resources will only be over-subscribed when explicitly requested
by the user using the "--oversubscribe" option on job submission.
May be followed with a colon and maximum number of jobs in
running or suspended state.
For example "OverSubscribe=YES:4" enables each node, socket or
core to execute up to four jobs at once.
Recommended only for systems running with gang scheduling
( PreemptMode=suspend,gang ).
NO [#OPT_NO_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Selected resources are allocated to a single job. No resource will be
allocated to more than one job.
NOTE : Even if you are using PreemptMode=suspend,gang , setting
OverSubscribe=NO will disable preemption on that partition. Use
OverSubscribe=FORCE:1 if you want to disable normal oversubscription
but still allow suspension due to preemption.
OverTimeLimit [#OPT_OverTimeLimit_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Number of minutes by which a job can exceed its time limit before
being canceled.
Normally a job's time limit is treated as a hard limit and the job will be
killed upon reaching that limit.
Configuring OverTimeLimit will result in the job's time limit being
treated like a soft limit.
Adding the OverTimeLimit value to the soft time limit provides a
hard time limit, at which point the job is canceled.
This is particularly useful for backfill scheduling, which bases upon
each job's soft time limit.
If not set, the OverTimeLimit value for the entire cluster will be used.
May not exceed 65533 minutes.
A value of "UNLIMITED" is also supported.
PartitionName [#OPT_PartitionName](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Name by which the partition may be referenced (e.g. "Interactive").
This name can be specified by users when submitting jobs.
If the PartitionName is "DEFAULT", the values specified
with that record will apply to subsequent partition specifications
unless explicitly set to other values in that partition record or
replaced with a different set of default values.
Each line where PartitionName is "DEFAULT" will replace or add to previous
default values and not reinitialize the default values.
PowerDownOnIdle [#OPT_PowerDownOnIdle](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) If set to "YES" and power saving is enabled for the partition, then nodes
allocated from this partition will be requested to power down after being
allocated at least one job.
These nodes will not power down until they transition from COMPLETING to IDLE.
If set to "NO" then power saving will operate as configured for the partition.
The default value is "NO".
See <[https://slurm.schedmd.com/power_save.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/power_save.html)> and
<[https://slurm.schedmd.com/elastic_computing.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/elastic_computing.html)> for more details.
NOTE :
The following will cause a transition from COMPLETING to IDLE:
Completing all running jobs without additional jobs being allocated.
ExclusiveUser=YES and after all running jobs complete but before another user's
job is allocated.
OverSubscribe=EXCLUSIVE and after the running job completes but before another
job is allocated.
NOTE :
Nodes are still subject to powering down when being IDLE for SuspendTime
when PowerDownOnIdle is set to NO.</p>
Also see SuspendTime .
PreemptMode [#OPT_PreemptMode_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Mechanism used to preempt jobs or enable gang scheduling for this
partition when PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio is configured.
This partition-specific PreemptMode configuration parameter will
override the cluster-wide PreemptMode for this partition.
It can be set to OFF to disable preemption and gang scheduling for this
partition.
See also PriorityTier and the above description of the cluster-wide
PreemptMode parameter for further details.
The GANG option is used to enable gang scheduling independent of
whether preemption is enabled (i.e. independent of the PreemptType
setting). It can be specified in addition to a PreemptMode setting with
the two options comma separated (e.g. PreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG ).
See <[preempt](https://slurm.schedmd.com/preempt.html)> and
<[gang_scheduling](https://slurm.schedmd.com/gang_scheduling.html)> for more details.
NOTE :
For performance reasons, the backfill scheduler reserves whole nodes for jobs,
not partial nodes. If during backfill scheduling a job preempts one or more
other jobs, the whole nodes for those preempted jobs are reserved for the
preemptor job, even if the preemptor job requested fewer resources than that.
These reserved nodes aren't available to other jobs during that backfill
cycle, even if the other jobs could fit on the nodes. Therefore, jobs may
preempt more resources during a single backfill iteration than they requested.
NOTE :
For heterogeneous job to be considered for preemption all components
must be eligible for preemption. When a heterogeneous job is to be preempted
the first identified component of the job with the highest order PreemptMode
( SUSPEND (highest), REQUEUE , CANCEL (lowest)) will be
used to set the PreemptMode for all components. The GraceTime and user
warning signal for each component of the heterogeneous job remain unique.
Heterogeneous jobs are excluded from GANG scheduling operations.
OFF [#OPT_OFF_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Disables job preemption and gang scheduling.
CANCEL [#OPT_CANCEL_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The preempted job will be cancelled.
GANG [#OPT_GANG_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Enables gang scheduling (time slicing) of jobs in the same partition, and
allows the resuming of suspended jobs.
NOTE :
Gang scheduling is performed independently for each partition, so
if you only want time-slicing by OverSubscribe , without any preemption,
then configuring partitions with overlapping nodes is not recommended.
On the other hand, if you want to use PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio
to allow jobs from higher PriorityTier partitions to Suspend jobs from lower
PriorityTier partitions you will need overlapping partitions, and
PreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG to use the Gang scheduler to resume the suspended
jobs(s).
In any case, time-slicing won't happen between jobs on different partitions.
NOTE :
Heterogeneous jobs are excluded from GANG scheduling operations.
REQUEUE [#OPT_REQUEUE_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Preempts jobs by requeuing them (if possible) or canceling them.
For jobs to be requeued they must have the --requeue sbatch option set
or the cluster wide JobRequeue parameter in slurm.conf must be set to 1 .
SUSPEND [#OPT_SUSPEND_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The preempted jobs will be suspended, and later the Gang scheduler will resume
them. Therefore the SUSPEND preemption mode always needs the GANG
option to be specified at the cluster level. Also, because the suspended jobs
will still use memory on the allocated nodes, Slurm needs to be able to track
memory resources to be able to suspend jobs.
If the preemptees and preemptor are on different partitions then the preempted
jobs will remain suspended until the preemptor ends.
NOTE : Because gang scheduling is performed independently for each
partition, if using PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio then jobs in
higher PriorityTier partitions will suspend jobs in lower PriorityTier
partitions to run on the released resources. Only when the preemptor job ends
will the suspended jobs will be resumed by the Gang scheduler.
NOTE : Suspended jobs will not release GRES. Higher priority jobs will not
be able to preempt to gain access to GRES.
PriorityJobFactor [#OPT_PriorityJobFactor](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Partition factor used by priority/multifactor plugin in calculating job priority.
Defaults to 1. A value of 0 prevents this partition from adding to the job's
priority. The value may not exceed 65533.
Also see PriorityTier.
PriorityTier [#OPT_PriorityTier](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Jobs submitted to a partition with a higher PriorityTier value will be
evaluated by the scheduler before pending jobs in a partition with a lower
PriorityTier value. They will also be considered for preemption of running
jobs in partition(s) with lower PriorityTier values if
PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio .
The value may not exceed 65533.
Also see PriorityJobFactor.
QOS [#OPT_QOS](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Used to extend the limits available to a QOS on a partition. Jobs will not be
associated to this QOS outside of being associated to the partition. They
will still be associated to their requested QOS.
By default, no QOS is used.
Additional details are in the QOS documentation at
<[https://slurm.schedmd.com/qos.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/qos.html)>, including special conditions
when a relative QOS is used for this parameter.
NOTE : If a limit is set in both the Partition's QOS and the Job's QOS,
the Partition QOS limit will be honored unless the Job's QOS has the
OverPartQOS flag set, in which case the Job's QOS limit will take
precedence.
ReqResv [#OPT_ReqResv](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specifies users of this partition are required to designate a reservation
when submitting a job. This option can be useful in restricting usage
of a partition that may have higher priority or additional resources to be
allowed only within a reservation.
Possible values are "YES" and "NO".
The default value is "NO".
ResumeTimeout [#OPT_ResumeTimeout_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Maximum time permitted (in seconds) between when a node resume request
is issued and when the node is actually available for use.
Nodes which fail to respond in this time frame will be marked DOWN and
the jobs scheduled on the node requeued if possible.
Nodes which reboot after this time frame will be marked DOWN with a reason of
"Node unexpectedly rebooted."
For nodes that are in multiple partitions with this option set,
the highest time will take effect. If not set on any partition, the node will
use the ResumeTimeout value set for the entire cluster. The maximum value
is either 65533 or INFINITE.
RootOnly [#OPT_RootOnly](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Specifies if only user ID zero (i.e. user root ) may allocate resources
in this partition. User root may allocate resources for any other user,
but the request must be initiated by user root.
This option can be useful for a partition to be managed by some
external entity (e.g. a higher-level job manager) and prevents
users from directly using those resources.
Possible values are "YES" and "NO".
The default value is "NO".
SelectTypeParameters [#OPT_SelectTypeParameters_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Partition-specific resource allocation type.
This option replaces the global SelectTypeParameters value.
Supported values are CR_Core , CR_Core_Memory , CR_Socket and
CR_Socket_Memory .
Use requires the system-wide SelectTypeParameters value be set to
any of the four supported values previously listed; otherwise, the
partition-specific value will be ignored.
Shared [#OPT_Shared](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) The Shared configuration parameter has been replaced by the
OverSubscribe parameter described above.
State [#OPT_State_2](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) State of partition or availability for use. Possible values
are "UP", "DOWN", "DRAIN" and "INACTIVE". The default value is "UP".
See also the related "Alternate" keyword.
UP [#OPT_UP](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Designates that new jobs may be queued on the partition, and that
jobs may be allocated nodes and run from the partition.
DOWN [#OPT_DOWN_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Designates that new jobs may be queued on the partition, but
queued jobs may not be allocated nodes and run from the partition. Jobs
already running on the partition continue to run. The jobs
must be explicitly canceled to force their termination.
DRAIN [#OPT_DRAIN_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Designates that no new jobs may be queued on the partition (job
submission requests will be denied with an error message), but jobs
already queued on the partition may be allocated nodes and run.
See also the "Alternate" partition specification.
INACTIVE [#OPT_INACTIVE](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Designates that no new jobs may be queued on the partition,
and jobs already queued may not be allocated nodes and run.
See also the "Alternate" partition specification.
SuspendTime [#OPT_SuspendTime_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Nodes which remain idle or down for this number of seconds will be placed into
power save mode by SuspendProgram .
For nodes that are in multiple partitions with this option set,
the highest time will take effect. If not set on any partition, the node will
use the SuspendTime value set for the entire cluster.
Setting SuspendTime to INFINITE will disable suspending of nodes in this
partition.
Setting SuspendTime to anything but INFINITE (or -1) will enable power
save mode.
SuspendTimeout [#OPT_SuspendTimeout_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Maximum time permitted (in seconds) between when a node suspend request
is issued and when the node is shutdown.
At that time the node must be ready for a resume request to be issued
as needed for new work.
For nodes that are in multiple partitions with this option set,
the highest time will take effect. If not set on any partition, the node will
use the SuspendTimeout value set for the entire cluster.
Topology [#OPT_Topology_1](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Name of the topology, defined in topology.yaml , used by jobs in this
partition.
TRESBillingWeights [#OPT_TRESBillingWeights](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Comma-separated list of < TRES Type >=< Numeric Weight > pairs defining
the billing weights of one or more tracked TRES types (see
AccountingStorageTRES ) that will be used in calculating the usage of a job
in this partition. The resulting usage amount is used when calculating fairshare
and when enforcing the TRES billing limit on jobs. See also
PriorityWeightTRES to adjust job priority directly based on TRES usage.
By default, jobs are billed against the total number of allocated CPUs
(TRESBillingWeights="CPU=1").
Refer to the TRES page for more details: <[https://slurm.schedmd.com/tres.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/tres.html)>
## PROLOG AND EPILOG SCRIPTS[#SECTION_PROLOG-AND-EPILOG-SCRIPTS](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html)
There are a variety of prolog and epilog program options that
execute with various permissions and at various times.
The four options most likely to be used are:
Prolog and Epilog (executed once on each compute node
for each job) plus PrologSlurmctld and EpilogSlurmctld
(executed once on the SlurmctldHost for each job).
NOTE : Standard output and error messages are normally not preserved.
Explicitly write output and error messages to an appropriate location
if you wish to preserve that information.
NOTE : By default the Prolog script is ONLY run on any individual
node when it first sees a job step from a new allocation. It does not
run the Prolog immediately when an allocation is granted. If no job steps
from an allocation are run on a node, it will never run the Prolog for that
allocation. This Prolog behavior can be changed by the
PrologFlags parameter. The Epilog, on the other hand, always
runs on every node of an allocation when the allocation is released.
If the Epilog fails (returns a non-zero exit code), this will result in the
node being set to a DRAIN state.
If the EpilogSlurmctld fails (returns a non-zero exit code), this will only
be logged.
If the Prolog fails (returns a non-zero exit code), this will result in the
node being set to a DRAIN state and the job being requeued. The job will be
placed in a held state unless nohold_on_prolog_fail is configured in
SchedulerParameters .
If the PrologSlurmctld fails (returns a non-zero exit code), this will result
in the job being requeued to be executed on another node if possible. Only
batch jobs can be requeued.
Interactive jobs (salloc and srun) will be cancelled if the
PrologSlurmctld fails.
If slurmctld is stopped while either PrologSlurmctld or EpilogSlurmctld is
running, the script will be killed with SIGKILL. The script will restart when
slurmctld restarts.
Information about the job is passed to the script using environment
variables. For a full list of environment variables please see the Prolog
and Epilog Guide <[https://slurm.schedmd.com/prolog_epilog.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/prolog_epilog.html)>.
## UNKILLABLE STEP PROGRAM SCRIPT[#SECTION_UNKILLABLE-STEP-PROGRAM-SCRIPT](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html)
This program can be used to take special actions to clean up the unkillable
processes and/or notify system administrators.
The program will be run as SlurmdUser (usually "root") on the compute
node where UnkillableStepTimeout was triggered.
Information about the unkillable job step is passed to the script using
environment variables.
SLURM_JOB_ID [#OPT_SLURM_JOB_ID](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Job ID.
SLURM_STEP_ID [#OPT_SLURM_STEP_ID](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Job Step ID. Note that the special steps "batch", "interactive", and "extern"
are reported not by name but with integer Step IDs 4294967291, 4294967290, and
4294967292 respectively.
## NETWORK TOPOLOGY[#SECTION_NETWORK-TOPOLOGY](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html)
Slurm is able to optimize job allocations to minimize network contention.
Special Slurm logic is used to optimize allocations on systems with a
three-dimensional interconnect.
and information about configuring those systems are available on
web pages available here: <[https://slurm.schedmd.com/](https://slurm.schedmd.com/)>.
For a hierarchical network, Slurm needs to have detailed information
about how nodes are configured on the network switches.
The TopologyPlugin parameter controls which plugin is used to
collect network topology information.
The only values presently supported are
"topology/flat" (best-fit logic over one-dimensional topology),
"topology/tree", and "topology/block" (both determine the network topology
based upon information contained in a topology.conf or topology.yaml file,
see "man topology.conf" and "man topology.yaml" for more information).
Future plugins may gather topology information directly from the network.
The topology information is optional.
If not provided, Slurm will perform a best-fit algorithm assuming the
nodes are in a one-dimensional array as configured and the communications
cost is related to the node distance in this array.
## RELOCATING CONTROLLERS[#SECTION_RELOCATING-CONTROLLERS](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html)
If the cluster's computers used for the primary or backup controller
will be out of service for an extended period of time, it may be
desirable to relocate them.
In order to do so, follow this procedure:
1. Stop the Slurm daemons on the old controller and nodes.
2. Modify the slurm.conf file appropriately.
3. Copy the files from the StateSaveLocation to the new controller or ensure
that they are accessible to the new controller via a shared drive.
4. Distribute the updated slurm.conf file to all nodes.
5. Restart the Slurm daemons on the new controller and nodes.
There should be no loss of any pending jobs. Any running jobs will get the
updated host info and finish normally.
Ensure that any nodes added to the cluster have the current
slurm.conf file installed.
CAUTION: If two nodes are simultaneously configured as the
primary controller (two nodes on which SlurmctldHost specify
the local host and the slurmctld daemon is executing on each),
system behavior will be destructive.
If a compute node has an incorrect SlurmctldHost
parameter, that node may be rendered
unusable, but no other harm will result.

## INCLUDE MODIFIERS[#SECTION_INCLUDE-MODIFIERS](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html)
The "include" key word can be used with modifiers within the specified
pathname. These modifiers would be replaced with cluster name or other
information depending on which modifier is specified. If the included file
is not an absolute path name (i.e. it does not start with a slash), it will
searched for in the same directory as the slurm.conf file.
%c [#OPT_%c](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) Cluster name specified in the slurm.conf will be used.
EXAMPLE
```text
ClusterName=linux include /home/slurm/etc/%c_config # Above line interpreted as # "include /home/slurm/etc/linux_config"
```

## LOGGING[#SECTION_LOGGING](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html)
Note that while Slurm daemons create log files and other files as needed,
it treats the lack of parent directories as a fatal error.
This prevents the daemons from running if critical file systems are
not mounted and will minimize the risk of cold-starting (starting
without preserving jobs).
Log files and job accounting files
may need to be created/owned by the "SlurmUser" uid to be successfully
accessed. Use the "chown" and "chmod" commands to set the ownership
and permissions appropriately.
See the section FILE AND DIRECTORY PERMISSIONS for information
about the various files and directories used by Slurm.
It is recommended that the logrotate utility be used to ensure that
various log files do not become too large.
This also applies to text files used for accounting,
process tracking, and the slurmdbd log if they are used.
Here is a sample logrotate configuration. Make appropriate site modifications
and save as /etc/logrotate.d/slurm on all nodes.
See the logrotate man page for more details.
```text
## # Slurm Logrotate Configuration ## /var/log/slurm/*.log { compress missingok nocopytruncate nodelaycompress nomail notifempty noolddir rotate 5 sharedscripts size=5M create 640 slurm root postrotate pkill -x --signal SIGUSR2 slurmctld pkill -x --signal SIGUSR2 slurmd pkill -x --signal SIGUSR2 slurmdbd exit 0 endscript }
